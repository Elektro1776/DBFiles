Arbitration. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS USER AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION’S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this User Agreement.\n2. Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.\n\n**Governing Law and Jurisdiction**. This User Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this User Agreement shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts of New York County, New York.\n\n**Modification**.

The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder\n\n**Force Majeure**. We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.\n\n**Assignment**.

We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent.\n\n**Agency**.

Unless otherwise specified in this User Agreement, all notices under this User Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.\n\n**No Waiver**. Our failure to enforce any part of this User Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of this User Agreement. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with this User Agreement to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.\n\n**Headings**.

While that’s not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">technically</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> true, there is some merit to what’s being said, but not for the reasons you might think.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As humans, each and every one of us carries with them an ‘energy.’ We have multiple energies, one of them being our sexual energy or intimate energy. Whenever we’re intimate with another person, these intimate energies of each person <a href="http://allietheiss.com/sharing-intimate-energy/">become merged or even absorbed by the other</a>.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you sleep with people who are full of positive, loving energy, you absorb that energy, and it brings you up. In the same manner, if you’re sleeping with negative, destructive people, you’ll notice a shift in your energy toward the other end of the spectrum.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If we don’t regularly cleanse our intimate and sexual energies, they become ‘contaminated’ (for lack of a better word) by the energies of the people we’ve been sleeping with. So, in that sense, we are kind of getting intimate with whoever else our partner has been getting intimate with, which is why <a href="http://www.the-auras-expert.com/aura-cleansing.html">it’s important to regularly cleanse your sexual energy</a>.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t, your energy will eventually be weighted down by all of the ‘dirt and debris’ you’ve collected from any partners over the course of time, which makes your vibration lower.</span>\n\n<b>Four ways to cleanse your intimate aura</b>\n\n<b>Aura meditation</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aura meditation helps us focus on ridding ourselves of undesirable energies that we may have acquired over time. Use meditation to regularly ground yourself by clearing your auras, energy channels and chakras. Use energy-based aura meditation to regularly cleanse your energetic being, just as you would take a shower or brush your teeth.</span>\n\n<b>Aura healings</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we need an aura healing, we seek out a healer who will help you cast away any unwanted energies. These healers are people who will help restore your flow of energy by removing any blockages. Reiki is one form of aura healing that is effective and popular in many areas.</span>\n\n<b>Aura readings</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between our own energies and foreign energies we’ve obtained from elsewhere. An aura reader will assist you in picking out which energies are yours and which ones you need to get rid of. Recognizing which energies are your own is important for getting rid of the right ones.</span>\n\n<b>Accept your emotions, and then express them</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we have emotional energy that does not get released or channeled in a proper way, it can create a blockage in our spiritual energy system. When this happens, unwanted energies get trapped inside. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid this, make sure you’re truly feeling any emotions that have hid themselves away. When we let ourselves experience these hidden emotions, we release that energy, which helps keep our systems flowing healthily.</span>\n\n<b>Other methods</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other practices that will help clean your aura, in addition to the four listed above, include:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Bathing in Epsom salt</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which helps stimulate energy flow and the removal of minor psychic debris.</span></li>\n \t<li><b>Swimming</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ocean water is chock-full of salt and minerals which are great for cleansing our energies and auras.</span></li>\n \t<li><b></b><b>Sunlight</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because lower vibrational frequencies do not exist without exposure to sunlight, and it helps stimulate the continued movement of your own energies.	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve probably heard someone say, “whenever you sleep with someone you’re also sleeping with all the people they’ve ever slept with” at some point in your life.

Once we’re out of school and thrusted into the real world, not every day is a social party where you’re surrounded by people you consider your friends. In fact, many people go to great lengths to try and make friends, but the truth is that if the other person isn’t interested, it probably won’t happen.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why it can be so hard to befriend introverts. As quiet, reserved folks, these people often get labeled as strange and unfriendly because, in Western culture, being quiet and reserved carries with it a somewhat negative stigma.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t let their behavior or attitude deter you when you know they’d make a good friend if you could get them to open up a little. Introverts make some of the best friends, so here are five things you can do, and five things you should avoid doing, to help your chances:</span>\n\n<b>Things you should try not to do:</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do your best to never put them “on the spot” when you’re around a large group of people. The attention makes them uncomfortable and embarrassed.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t try to make small talk. Introverts often despise small talk, preferring instead to discuss matters of actual substance. Plus, small talk puts pressure on them to come up with conversation.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t act like their shy personality is a certain ‘condition’ or illness. They’re not interested in making friends with people who see them as charity cases.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re talking with them, let the conversation flow naturally. If you awkwardly struggle to maintain a conversation, it will make their insides crawl. They hate awkward situations.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try not to force them to do anything that is outside of their realm of comfort. They’re simply not going to try something new just because you want them to. They will never trust you again and will likely never want to see you again.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<b>Things you want to do:</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to be by yourself when you approach an introvert, as groups of people make introverts feel a tad bit socially overwhelmed.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a soothing, somewhat quiet voice when you speak to them. This puts them at ease and is easier to process than loud, abrasive tones.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a mutual interest or problem and then talk about it together. Introverts like building connections over personal and meaningful conversation.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only hang out with them for short periods of time at first. They enjoy having time to work through things, which includes you and everything you’ve said to them. So give them space and time to make up their mind about you.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make eye contact only for brief moments. When you maintain eye contact for too long, the brain’s ‘fight-or-flight’ mechanism becomes triggered, making you seem more intimidating than you are.\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you continue to get older, making friends continues to get harder.

She has grown from devastating experiences. She’s ventured out into the deep end, knowing that she would only have herself to rely on. She’s self-sufficient and independent, while also being kind, loving and humble.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five reasons why men have a difficult time with strong women:</span>\n\n<b>Strong women do not rely on men to fight their battles</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Men love feeling like the object of desire when it comes to their significant other. They like having something to fight for. Strong women are capable of loving their men while simultaneously being completely independent and self-reliant. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong woman likes fighting for both herself and her partner, but when it comes down to it, they’re not going to wait around for a man to solve any problems. Many men can’t fathom the idea of not being in a position of control or dominance.</span>\n\n<b>Strong women know what they want</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong woman is likely strong because, not only do they know exactly what they want out of life, but they’ve had to overcome quite a bit of adversity to achieve it. This means that they’re not the type to wait for a man to approach them. If they’re interested in a man, they’ll be the ones to make it known. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rarely the submissive type, strong women do best with men who are self-confident and comfortable with a woman taking charge.</span>\n\n<b>Strong women need honest men who can be vulnerable</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many men struggle when it comes to being vulnerable. It can be scary having to let down your walls for someone. But strong women need a man who is capable of being honest and open, because they’re not afraid to talk about the traumatic, painful experiences of life. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong women are not afraid of their pasts. So, they need a partner who is ready to let go of that and take on the challenges still yet to come. </span>\n\n<b>Strong women are not afraid of being intimate</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong woman challenges her partner to be intimate in every way possible. From casual conversation to a passionate life in the bedroom, they don’t hold back. Strong women are very in tune with their femininity. They will not settle for anything less than a passionate, emotional connection.</span>\n\n<b>Strong women see straight through lies</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong women have an uncanny ability to see past any lies people attempt to slip by them. Because of this, they expect 100 percent loyalty and trust in their relationships. If you’re not committed to her fully, or approach the relationship from a less-than-genuine place, she’s not going to keep you around. Be honest and straight with her.</span>	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong women come in all different shapes and sizes, but many of them share similar traits and qualities due to the events, circumstances, and people that have shaped them into the strong women they are. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong woman has overcome adversity in her life.

I grew up on old romantic movies and novels, I couldn’t wait to ***fall***. So, when I got older I tried to fall in love…a lot and very quickly. I wanted novel-like love, fairy-tale love, a love like Hollywood portrays. I thought love was an obsession with someone, not a commitment to them.\n\nMy unhealthy addiction with a delusional and false portrayal of love stems from a childhood of wanting to be loved. From being severely bullied to coming from a divorced family, I quickly and mistakenly learned to believe I could not be loved and if someone did love me, I did not believe them.

It’s so sweet isn’t it? The first stages of wooing someone or being wooed. The all-consuming thoughts, manic energy and the feeling that maybe and finally you have met *the one*.  All you can think about is this mysterious human being, it is all you want to talk about.

Falling lead to real feeling and you chose to start a life with this wonderful person. By this point, you’ve met some of their flaws and probably have been annoyed with them a time or two, three, okay maybe four times. Loving this person means accepting them for their flaws and selflessly giving a part of yourself to them because you want them to be loved and for them to love you in return, despite your own issues.\n\nLoving someone doesn’t mean you won’t experience thoughts of immense love you have for this person, it just becomes more realistic. It may be a fleeting thought or racing heart thinking to yourself “I can’t believe this person loves me the way that they do, no matter what.” To me, that’s better than an endless stream of wild what ifs and anxiety-filled nights.\n\nYou will never own someone you truly love, you won’t want to. You want them to feel free and better themselves on a daily basis, to be confident in you and themselves. Jealousy is natural, but obsessive and controlling behavior is not real love. Everyone goes through it and everyone is guilty of being obsessive at least once. I don’t care if you hide it, the point is… you still do it. When you actually love someone, you won’t feel the need to act like this.\n\nIt’s not a chemical romance, it is real. You don’t need the constant high to remind you that you love them, it’s just there. You aren’t really searching for happiness elsewhere, you are content. Every decision you make, every hardship you face, and when you just need someone to listen, they are always there. You know that no matter what, you will always and forever love them.\n\nThere is no battle, there is only **love. **  \n**About the Author: **\n\n[**Kate Rae**](http://katerae.wordpress.com) is an intuitive writer discussing the world of mental illness and how healthy living and a little humor can greatly improve your well being.

I grew up on old romantic movies and novels, I couldn’t wait to <strong><em>fall</em></strong>. So, when I got older I tried to fall in love…a lot and very quickly. I wanted novel-like love, fairy-tale love, a love like Hollywood portrays. I thought love was an obsession with someone, not a commitment to them.</p>\n\n<p>My unhealthy addiction with a delusional and false portrayal of love stems from a childhood of wanting to be loved. From being severely bullied to coming from a divorced family, I quickly and mistakenly learned to believe I could not be loved and if someone did love me, I did not believe them. I still hoped a ‘perfect’ and crazy kind of love existed, just not for me.

Wow, I really don’t ever want to be someone’s trap queen…I really don’t even understand what that is.\n\nAs I witness some of our generation slowly begin to wake up, it gives me hope that we could be remembered for something great. I believe in soulmates and that there are certain people meant for you, at a certain time along your life path. I think, when you are your best (or close to it), you meet your unique counterpart. Who wouldn’t want to experience that?\n\nThe more you focus on loving yourself and those around you who deserve it (and some who don’t), the more positive the vibes you are leaking out. I wish people would just realize how important love is, because love is powerful and it could save us from a world full of selfishness, hatred, and greed.\n\nHere are some reasons why I think people are giving up on love.\n\n- **Speed Dating. **This is basically what people do, trying to find their ‘one and only’ rapidly moving through people like there is no tomorrow. Where is the spontaneity in that? The romance? No where. Dating as a sport isn’t going to get you any closer to ‘the one’. Dating someone who isn’t right for you just for the sake of dating will lead you nowhere but straight into disaster. Work on loving who you are and bettering yourself everyday, then the right person for you will come along.\n- **The Ego is Taking Over. **Part of the ego is sometimes recognized as arrogance. Boy, does our generation have a sh*t ton of that. It’s all about status, money, and how many followers you have on Twitter. An overboard of selfies so a bunch of people you may or may not know can tell you how awesome you are. The other part of the ego is insecurity. Feeling insecure when you see a beautiful picture of someone else or jealousy of how someones lifestyle is displayed through imagery.\n- **Lack of Respect For One’s Self. **Sleeping around, posting half naked pictures, and pretending to be someone you are not is all just disrespecting yourself. Giving someone your mind, your body, and your soul is a beautiful experience and we suck the beauty right out of it. Sex is great and it is meant to be great, with the *right* person. A person who loves and respects you, not someone who just wants to feel great in the moment but for a *lifetime. *Wanna Netflix and chill? Nope, I want to turn off Netflix and make love, thank you very much.\n- **The World is at Our Fingertips. **Literally, by the click of a mouse we can instantly have anything we want. If we are hungry we can wait in a drive-thru for a few minutes or have it delivered to our doorsteps. Need clothes? Order them online! Millions of apps and Google search help us to not have to work for anything. Why work at being in love for a lifetime, when you can experience it in one night?\n- **Partying is More Important Than Building Lasting Relationships. **All our generation cares about is drugs and alcohol. An instant feeling of numbness to take away emotional pain, not having to face it and work through your issues is addicting. Some people drink and do drugs to intensify emotions of love and sexual desire, creating an illusion of what it’s actually really like to love someone. Thus, to work for love or wait for a lasting union is not needed.\n- **We Don’t Know How to Love. **Love has and always will be complex. Our generation isn’t the only one in history who are confused by this phenomena. Love is scary,  it makes you vulnerable and susceptible to the worst kind of pain you have ever felt. Contrary to this, love is beautiful, selfless and inspiring. Most love stories aren’t fairy tales, people have to work for it and *wait* for it. Are you willing to begin to understand love for what it actually is? Or, would you rather pretend it to be something it is not just so you can get a quick, but false taste?\n\nI’ve experienced first hand some of the issues I listed above, I’ll admit it. It taught me a lot and one day I realized I want no part of the facades our generation is becoming apart of. What about you?\n\n**About the Author: **\n\n[**Kate Rae**](http://katerae.wordpress.com) is an intuitive writer discussing the world of mental illness and how healthy living and a little humor can greatly improve your well being.

1309	31e9a9d5-9c16-4989-9460-3300c943d547	5 Laws of Karma	5-laws-of-karma	\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Laws of **[Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma)** can viewed as the Buddhist and Hindu version of the Golden Rule, which is basically that you should do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  This Golden Rule is stated by practically every religion in the world, as it teaches us that we are responsible for our actions.  </span>\n\nBuddhism goes a bit further, incorporating intention and thought, as well as spoken word and action.  Everything we feel, say, do, and every choice we make ripples through time, and these choices are our karma, whether they be good or bad.  Check out these five Laws of Karma:\n\n**Law of Neutrality – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same way that gravity acts as neutral and constant force, the Laws of Karma apply to all beings equally, without exception.  It exists without favorite ones, without cursed ones; there are only the divine beings manifested by the Creator, and all of these beings are loved and cared for equally, deeply, and completely.</span>\n\n**Law of Lessons – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we **[reincarnate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation)** we do so to learn what is and is not like love.  When moving through worlds of duality, we learn from experiencing the extreme opposites: good-bad, problem-solution, etc. until we are able to evolve into **[divine love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_of_God)**, joy and awareness.  One walks the divine circle until their lessons are learned.</span>\n\n**Law of Balance – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">The objective in learning lessons is to achieve a sense of balance.  Imbalances are what drive your personal cycle of reincarnation.  For example, whatever you bring hate to, is what you reincarnate to, so that you might have the opportunity to achieve balance.  Because you can only truly understand a thing when you become that thing; ceasing judgement and the harboring of unrealistic expectations.</span>\n\n**Law of Expansion – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because everything in the universe is energy, the universe is constantly expanding from lower to higher vibrational levels.  And due to this constant expansion, change and growth are all but certain.  The universe grows by weaving its way through chaos, reorganization, and order in one long endless cycle of change and growth, executed in hopes of continuous improvement.</span>\n\n**Law of Love – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Karma comes full circle with love.  The entire purpose of Karma is to propel your soul on a personal journey of reincarnation through the universe, eventually bringing all of us into a state of divine love, joy and awareness.  Karma ceases when you have perfected your ability to love unconditionally.  </span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="878" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ZX8QSdJ9go?feature=oembed" width="1170"></iframe>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Laws of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma">Karma</a></strong> can viewed as the Buddhist and Hindu version of the Golden Rule, which is basically that you should do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  This Golden Rule is stated by practically every religion in the world, as it teaches us that we are responsible for our actions.  </span></p>\n\n<p>Buddhism goes a bit further, incorporating intention and thought, as well as spoken word and action.  Everything we feel, say, do, and every choice we make ripples through time, and these choices are our karma, whether they be good or bad.  Check out these five Laws of Karma:</p>\n\n<p><em>*Law of Neutrality – *</em><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same way that gravity acts as neutral and constant force, the Laws of Karma apply to all beings equally, without exception.  It exists without favorite ones, without cursed ones;

associated with your birth year, then read below to see which characteristics you inherit from your Chinese Zodiac sign:\n\n**Rats – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rats are charming and thoughtful individuals, touting strong and vivid imaginations, and generosity in relationships that are important to them.  They can be quick-tempered and critical, but are typically at ease when in company and social settings.  They’re usually quite intellectual and enjoy notable popularity.</span>\n\n**Ox – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ox is known for being stoic and strong.  They face adversity head on and inspire confidence in others.  They handle their responsibilities methodically and often garner respect because of it.  They can come off as arrogant at times because they defend their interests with extreme determination, but this same determination is admirable as it founded in a sense of duty.</span>\n\n**Tigers – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tiger is highly sensitive and often turns to its emotions, allowing it to love deeply.  The Tiger needs to find the balance between their need for love, their strong competitive spirit, and their desire to dominate.  They’re well-suited for leadership, as they courageously face any and all challenges.</span>\n\n**Rabbits / Hare – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbits are well-liked people because of their affectionate and courteous nature.  They dislike drama, preferring to stay out of it.  They focus mainly on pursuits that make them happy, and would never deliberately hurt anyone.  Despite their fun-loving nature, they are usually quiet and reserved.</span>\n\n**Dragons – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dragons are vibrant with energy and demonstrate a great charismatic presence, which can often come off as boisterous and loud occasionally.  They’re very talented people due to their high intelligence.  They enjoy demanding situations that provide them with opportunity to use all of their energies and talents to succeed.</span>\n\n**Snakes – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Snakes are known for their wisdom and ability for profound thought.  They’re also quite charming and romantic.  Despite this quality for love, they are often loners and prefer secrecy.  This leads many snakes to be less socially popular than their peers, but that’s ok because the snake prefers its own company.</span>\n\n**Horses – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Horse people prefer independence and hard work, which is often revealed in their characteristic egotism.  They possess great verbal acuity and a high intellectual capacity, however, providing them with the opportunity to be quite popular.  They will commit to hard work and success as long as the work they are doing is not seen as beneath them.</span>\n\n**Sheep – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheep are charming and likable folks, even if they are reserved.  A sheep person possesses a love for nature, art, and culture, and often commands a great deal of creativity themselves.  They can be timid, but are generally self-confident.  They are most fulfilled when in a relationship that provides security.</span>\n\n**Monkeys – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Intelligent and energetic, the Monkey touts a magnetic personality that draws people in.  They are often viewed as eccentric due to their quick wit and easy talent for finding humor in every situation.  </span>\n\n**Roosters – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Roosters are known for their inclination toward industry and hard work, as well as their ability to easily express their views.  They do not like to share the spotlight with others, as they view their own opinions, and their right to share them, as highly important.  They can be very true and loyal in relationships, and have potential for success in their careers due to their high standards.</span>\n\n**Dogs – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dog people are notorious for their honesty and loyalty in relationships.  When they choose to tackle a new pursuit, they give it their all, whether it be in their career or their hobbies.  Dogs have sharp tongues that feel the need to criticize often, partly due to the fact that they adhere strongly to principles of justice and fairness.</span>\n\n**Pigs – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pig people make wonderful companions because of their ability to be sincere, kind, and tolerant.  They use their intellect to set high goals and then achieve them.  They have great sense of humor and possess great wit.  Their desire for social harmony allows them to overlook the faults in people, but this is also their greatest vulnerability, as they expect others to do the same.</span>\n\n \n\n\n	\N	<p>Find your birth year on the chart

1311	ac38dd33-8358-417c-a39b-dadcd4c60126	Privacy Policy	privacy-policy	\n### Overview\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Heart Centered Rebalancing. (“we”, “our” or “us”) on the collection, use and disclosure of your information on www.[heartcenteredrebalancing.com](http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/) (the “Site”) and the services, features, content or applications we offer (collectively with the Site, the “Services”). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for the Site and the Services, through your user account on the Services (your “Account”); (ii) your use of the Services generally; and (iii) from third party websites and services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n### What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?\n\nThis Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.\n\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications, such as Facebook (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.\n\n### What Information Do We Collect?\n\nThe information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.\n\n#### User Content\n\nSome features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written comments. All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n#### IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically\n\nWe automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP address and cookie information. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).\n\nGenerally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.\n\n#### Email Communications\n\nWe may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer service.\n\n#### Information Collected Using Cookies\n\nCookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet.\n\nOur cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services.\n\nMost browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage the most attractive features of the Services.\n\nThis Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.\n\n#### Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons\n\nTo support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.\n\nAdvertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category may be based on anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age), may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.\n\nTo increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.\n\n#### Aggregate Information\n\nWe collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services (“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you or your web browser.\n\n### How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?\n\nThe Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information generated through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties.\n\n#### Public Information about Your Activity on the Services\n\nSome of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to, content you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services, such as written posts, comments, or other submissions by you to the Site.\n\nPlease also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.\n\n#### IP Address Information\n\nWhile we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.\n\n#### Information You Elect to Share\n\nYou may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party Services from within the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.\n\n#### Aggregate Information\n\nWe share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.\n\n#### Information Shared with Our Agents\n\nWe employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”). We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.\n\n#### Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers\n\nIn some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.\n\n#### Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others\n\nWe also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.\n\n#### Information We Share With Your Consent\n\nExcept as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.\n\n### Is Information About Me Secure?\n\nWe store all of our information, including your IP address information, using industry-standard techniques. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Information or otherwise.\n\n### What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?\n\nYou can use many of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of information that we collect.\n\nYou can always opt not to disclose certain information to us, even though it may be needed to take advantage of some of our features.\n\n### What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?\n\nWe may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.\n\n### What If I Have Questions or Concerns?\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message through our Contact Us page.\n\n*Effective Date: 06-09-2013*\n\n \n\n\n	\N	<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>\n\n<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Heart Centered Rebalancing. (“we”, “our” or “us”) on the collection, use and disclosure of your information on www.<a href="http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/">heartcenteredrebalancing.com</a> (the “Site”) and the services, features, content or applications we offer (collectively with the Site, the “Services”). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for the Site and the Services, through your user account on the Services (your “Account”); (ii) your use of the Services generally; and (iii) from third party websites and services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n\n<h3 id="whatdoesthisprivacypolicycover">What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>\n\n<p>This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.</p>\n\n<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications, such as Facebook (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>\n\n<h3 id="whatinformationdowecollect">What Information Do We Collect?</h3>\n\n<p>The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.</p>\n\n<h4 id="usercontent">User Content</h4>\n\n<p>Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written comments. All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n\n<h4 id="ipaddressinformationandotherinformationcollectedautomatically">IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically</h4>\n\n<p>We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP address and cookie information. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).</p>\n\n<p>Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.</p>\n\n<h4 id="emailcommunications">Email Communications</h4>\n\n<p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer service.</p>\n\n<h4 id="informationcollectedusingcookies">Information Collected Using Cookies</h4>\n\n<p>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services.</p>\n\n<p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage the most attractive features of the Services.</p>\n\n<p>This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.</p>\n\n<h4 id="informationrelatedtoadvertisingandtheuseofwebbeacons">Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons</h4>\n\n<p>To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.</p>\n\n<p>Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category may be based on anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age), may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.</p>\n\n<p>To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>\n\n<h4 id="aggregateinformation">Aggregate Information</h4>\n\n<p>We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services (“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you or your web browser.</p>\n\n<h3 id="howandwithwhomismyinformationshared">How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?</h3>\n\n<p>The Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information generated through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties.</p>\n\n<h4 id="publicinformationaboutyouractivityontheservices">Public Information about Your Activity on the Services</h4>\n\n<p>Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to, content you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services, such as written posts, comments, or other submissions by you to the Site.</p>\n\n<p>Please also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.</p>\n\n<h4 id="ipaddressinformation">IP Address Information</h4>\n\n<p>While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n\n<h4 id="informationyouelecttoshare">Information You Elect to Share</h4>\n\n<p>You may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party Services from within the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.</p>\n\n<h4 id="aggregateinformation">Aggregate Information</h4>\n\n<p>We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.</p>\n\n<h4 id="informationsharedwithouragents">Information Shared with Our Agents</h4>\n\n<p>We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”). We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.</p>\n\n<h4 id="informationdisclosedpursuanttobusinesstransfers">Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers</h4>\n\n<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>\n\n<h4 id="informationdisclosedforourprotectionandtheprotectionofothers">Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</h4>\n\n<p>We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public.

 It’s a hard question to answer.  Feeling lost is often confused as a negative emotion, when it actually means that you’re starting to live in the present moment.  Living outside of the narrative you have in your head regarding your life can be tough, but it’s a good thing.  Get used to living in the moment, it’s where you want to be.</span>\n\n**Left Brain Fuzziness – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">The right hemisphere of our brain is associated with intuition, creativity and emotions.  As you start to activate your right brain hemisphere more often, the left side of your brain gets a little groggy.  Tasks that involve organization, intense focus, and attention to detail will come less easy to you than they did before, but have no fear, you’re in a good place.</span>\n\n**Having a strong need to be alone – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">I get this feeling often, although I admit that I can be introverted at times.  When you find yourself suddenly uninterested in socializing with anyone this is a sign that you’re simply rebooting your system.  People’s problems and antics can wane on you, leaving you exhausted or feeling a little disconnected.  It’s all good, just take some time for yourself.</span>\n\n**Feeling like your dreams are failing – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that life narrative that I mentioned earlier?

to express their disappointments, frustrations and anger in different ways.  Maybe you’re the type to sit in the corner and brood or maybe you’re the type to start yelling and causing a big scene.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anger is multi-faceted emotion and there are endless ways to express it.  But your Zodiac sign also has a lot to say about how you handle yourself when you’re feeling pissed off. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is each Zodiac sign’s way of expressing anger:</span>\n\n**Aries (March 21 – April 19) | Temper tantrums**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aries are notorious for being firecrackers, and when it comes to anger, they’re prone to sudden outbursts.  They don’t like to sugarcoat things for anyone, so if they’re upset with you, you’ll know about it.</span>\n\n**Taurus (April 20 – May 20) | Build up and explode**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taurus is a dangerous person to upset, as they won’t initially let you know that they’re mad at you.  They let their emotions simmer, subtly trying to give hints that you’ve upset them before letting all of their boiling anger come flowing out like an erupting volcano.</span>\n\n**Gemini (May 21 – June 20) | Verbal expression**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Geminis are so obsessed with talking, it should come as no surprise that their anger is unleashed via their sharp tongues.  They like to scream, shout and throw insults that cut to the very core of a person’s being.</span>\n\n**Cancer (June 21 – July 22) | Kind of all over the place**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cancer doesn’t openly express their anger until they’ve taken all that they can handle.  First they sulk, then they become passive-aggressive, and then they become reclusive.  If no one has taken the time to try and remedy this situation, they go from crying to intense outbursts of anger.</span>\n\n**Leo (July 23 – August 22) | RAAAWR!**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Leo is quite apt at expressing anger.  When they’re pissed off, they love to shout and yell while becoming an intense storm of anger and fury.  They swear like sailors and use vulgar language during their outbursts.</span>\n\n**Virgo (August 23 – September 22) | Brood and brood**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Virgos don’t particularly enjoy letting their anger out, so what usually happens is they hold all of it in for as long as they can until something tiny lights their fuse, blowing them into orbit.  Their anger is usually never about something immediate that happened, but rather something that happened long ago.</span>\n\n**Libra (September 23 – October 22) | Seething behind the scenes**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Libras despise confrontation and hate showing their anger because they think it makes them less attractive.  They try not to let their angry emotions get to them, but sometimes they do and they will lose their cool.</span>\n\n**Scorpio (October 23 – November 21) | We are the fury**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes a lot to get the Scorpio fired up, but should you somehow achieve this feat, be prepared for a venomous wrath.  Scorpios are adept at destroying a person with verbal onslaughts and looks that could kill, and they’re not quick to forgive or forget what you’ve done.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius (November 22 – December 21) | One big ball of fire**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sagittarius has no fear of turning it up to 11.  If you piss them off they’ll get rid of you in a heartbeat.  Try to distract them from their anger, as they will often lose sight of why they were even upset in the first place.</span>\n\n**Capricorn (December 22 – January 19) | Destroy everything you touch**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Capricorn isn’t likely to express anger until their threshold has been reached.  Once it has been reached though, they’re likely to want to break something, like the spirit of the person who has wronged them or that lamp in the corner over there.  </span>\n\n**Aquarius (January 20 – February 18) | Let it go, let it gooo**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Sagittarius has no chill, then the Aquarius has all of the chill.  When they’re upset they’ll simply disengage with everyone around them and go for a drive, or walk around for a bit until they’re not upset anymore.  If they can’t seem to let it go, they’ll eventually lose their temper and dump all of their negative emotions on you.</span>\n\n**Pisces (February 19 – March) | Up, down and all around**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pisces aren’t ones to typically get very angry, which makes it all the worse when they finally do.  However, the only person they ever seem to get upset with is themselves.  Their rage includes violent, self-destructive behaviors, often requiring a bit of healing after they’re done with an outburst.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone likes to express their disappointments, frustrations and anger in different ways.  Maybe you’re the type to sit in the corner

word ‘**[superfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfood)**’ gets tossed around a lot these days to describe foods that are supposedly really healthy for you.  Avocado is one of the foods often mentioned and with good reason.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the fruit part of the avocado great for you, but the avocado seed is great for you as well.  Packed with a myriad of health benefits, try saving your avocado seeds next time you find yourself cutting into one, it might just save your life.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five great reasons to start saving and eating your avocado seeds:</span>\n\n**Full of antioxidants**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While the avocado fruit might get most of the attention, its seed is where 70 percent of its antioxidants are found.  **[These antioxidants](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/79/5/727.full)** help the body in a variety of different ways, including the neutralization of free radicals, which have ties to many different diseases as well as obesity.</span>\n\n**High fiber content**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The avocado seed has an incredibly **[high soluble fiber](http://www.webmd.com/diet/insoluble-soluble-fiber)** content, averaging more soluble fibers than most foods that exist on Earth today.</span>\n\n**They can help ease digestion**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In South America, the avocado seed has been used for several generations as a treatment solution for dysentery and gastrointestinal tract problems.  The seed helps reduce inflammation, prevent ulcers and can help get rid of constipation.  Additionally, it has antibacterial properties and helps fight viral diseases and infections.</span>\n\n**Anti-cancer properties**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Avocado seeds contain**[flavonol, which is a very strong antioxidant](http://nutrition.ucdavis.edu/content/infosheets/fact-pro-flavonol.pdf)** that helps prevent, and even reduce, tumor growth.  Science journal </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharmaceutical Biology</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> found evidence that the avocado

avocado seed has high levels of dietary fiber, it’s a natural choice for lowering cholesterol because it stops cholesterol from being absorbed by the blood.  It has also been seen to reduce plaque, which is known to cause heart attacks and strokes.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word ‘<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfood">superfood</a></strong>’ gets

 According to your sign, your pet peeves and the types of things that irritate you can be found in the stars.  Check out your sign and see if it matches up with the things that bother you:</span>\n\n**Aquarius – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignorance, particularly in those who you think should know better.  Aquarians are progressive, meaning they can’t stand those people who make unfair assumptions about the random nature of life.</span>\n\n**Pisces – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">People who don’t understand where you’re coming from.  Pisces don’t enjoy sharp criticism; they hate when they’re trying to explain something and their friends can’t seem to get it.</span>\n\n**Aries – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">You despise people who take </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">forever</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get anything done.  This sounds like my roommate, he’s always nagging me to get ready quicker because he’s been ready since 15 minutes before we decided on anything.</span>\n\n**Taurus – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taurus are not a fan of change to their routines.  You don’t enjoy friend groups that are full of drama.  Change can be ok, unless it goes so far as to set you back to starting all over again.</span>\n\n**Gemini – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gemini is not a fan of the dull or boring.  Their firecracker nature causes them to be easily annoyed with being bored.  If the person you’re talking to is about as interesting as watching paint dry, you’re not interested.  They need excitement in all forms.</span>\n\n**Cancer – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cancer hates invasion of their personal space.  They enjoy keeping their personal lives on the down-low, meaning they don’t like people who like to pry into their lives.</span>\n\n**Leo – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Us Leos hate the silent treatment.  If you get into a huge fight with a Leo and then give them the silent treatment, they’re likely going to try to throw you off the top of a building.  Leos like people who are real and honest with them, so silence comes off as a weakness.</span>\n\n**Virgo – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rudeness and meanness for no reason whatsoever really upsets the Virgo.  Virgos are often the ones who get into fights with people over the tone of their voice or unnecessarily poor behavior.  </span>\n\n**Libra – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Libras despise people who are seemingly incompetent.  The Libra enjoys order, meaning that those who mess the order up are immediately in the doghouse.  Life isn’t that hard, people need to get their lives together.</span>\n\n**Scorpio – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scorpios despise liars.  They take pride in being the ultimate “no bullsh*t” type of people.  They’ll call out anyone who is practicing being phony.  They don’t accept lies and are pretty blunt about everything.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">These people hate finding themselves boxed in; they have restless spirits that hate stagnation.  It drives them absolutely nuts to be stuck in a dead-end job that’s leading nowhere, or when they’re in an environment where everything is always the same.</span>\n\n**Capricorn – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Capricorn doesn’t enjoy clingy people.  They’re highly independent people who don’t enjoy those who like to latch on.  Their lovers and partners are no exception, either.  And seeing others become dependent on others upsets them.  People need to learn to fly solo.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel a strong connection with your Zodiac sign?

My point here is to say that anything is possible, but not everything is *probable*. </span>\n\n<span class="s1">So why are wings, a jetpack and a rekindled relationship improbable with the Law of Attraction? Simple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*You don’t expect to have them.*</span>\n\n<span class="s1">In order to have anything (including the wings and the trips to the moon), only one thing has to change, and that is your expectation.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">With the Law of Attraction, we create our reality through our expectation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we see ourselves as lovable, love comes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we don’t, it stays far, far away.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">This is why getting an ex back can be challenging in the midst of a breakup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After someone has stomped on your heart and rejected you, it can be hard to see yourself as lovable.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">When you are beaten down and feeling badly, you simply aren’t in a state of expecting love to happen to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is why people get so sad when they are dumped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That former hopefulness has evaporated, and it has been replaced by an expectation of loneliness and despair.</span>\n\n***Related Article:** “**[14 Things to Stop Saying Now if You Want to Find Love](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2015/12/03/if-you-want-to-find-love/ "find love article")“***\n\n<span class="s1">For this reason, when I work with people who want to get an ex back, I make it 100% clear from the beginning that letting the ex go is the most important thing that needs to be done.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">*This doesn’t mean you’ll never get him or her back, *it simply means that from where you stand (energetically speaking) it is probably just about impossible to expect that this person will come back, and this lack of expectation pushes the old partner further away.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">To clarify this point, let me offer a very common human experience:</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Imagine you have a friend who went on a couple of dates with a guy and she ju</span><span class="s1">st can’t get him out of her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She texts him constantly, follows him around and flirts shamelessly to get his attention. </span>\n\n<span class="s1">But instead of falling head over heels in love with her, what happens? He runs for the hills!</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Now your friend is sad and down for a long time, and she becomes obsessed with getting him back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She talks about the situation endlessly, and now she’s asking your advice on how to get him back.The situation just becomes more and more desperate, and the guy in question is only getting further and further away.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Then finally, one day she decides she’s sick of obsessing about this guy and that she’s ready to move on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She picks herself up, and gets back out on the dating scene. She works on her happiness and gets her energy back on track.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Then what happens? </span>\n\n<span class="s1">Suddenly, Prince Charming is back sniffing around again! He texts her and calls her and tries to win back her affections. Now that she’s moved on and back to feeling good about herself, he wants to take her on a date again. Oh the irony!</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Chances are you know someone who has experienced this phenomena (and maybe you’ve even experienced it yourself!).</span>\n\n<span class="s1">See, when we allow ourselves to let go of people we have been chasing after, we stop focusing on our expectation of being unlovable, and this allows love to come to us much more easily. We put our focus on loving ourselves, and this focus attracts love back into our life.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">So if you’ve been wanting to get an ex back, do yourself a favor. Make it your new goal to get over your ex, and see what happens.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Maybe the ex will come back, maybe you’ll find a new love interest, but for SURE you will start feeling better and you will release a lot of the energy that is preventing you from developing the expectation you need to find true love.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Letting go of your ex is a necessary step on the path to finding love after heartbreak.</span>\n\n***Related Article:** “**[5 Possible Reasons Why You’re Still Single](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/01/13/reasons-why-youre-still-single/ "Why You're Still Single Article")“***\n\n<span class="s1">So to answer the question “can you get your ex back with the Law of Attraction?” the answer is a resounding YES.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, it is done through letting go, not through trying.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">To all my friends out there licking their wounds and feeling bad about love, take heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You don’t have to work to get him or her back. You don’t need to strategize or think about it. </span>\n\n<span class="s1">You only have to do one thing, and that is to let him or her go by doing whatever you can do to get over it. Fortunately, there are a lots of ways you can use the Law of Attraction to help you let go and get your happy back.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">When you are<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>truly ready to let go and make your happiness your #1 priority, events and circumstances will shift in your life. You will start loving yourself again, and the universe will respond by bringing more love into your life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All you have to do is put yourself first.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">If you have any questions about love and the Law of Attraction, feel free to**[contact me](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/contact-raise-your-vibration-today/ "Contact me here")**and let me know how I can help. There are many ways you can use the Law of Attraction to recover from the sadness of heartbreak and move on to happier times.

style="font-weight: 400;">Emotional abuse and manipulation happens more often than you might think.  The worst part is that sometimes you don’t even realize that it’s happening, which is what makes it so toxic.  A person who is good at it will make you miserable and confused as to why.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best things a person can do to make sure they don’t fall prey to one of these psychopaths is to learn how to spot manipulative and abusive behavior. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If any of these five signs of emotional abuse are shockingly familiar, there’s a good chance you need to end your relationship:</span>\n\n**Their criticism, judgment, and jokes at your expense are constant**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being teased and being humiliated are two very different things.  So, if your partner has a habit of degrading you in your home and out in public, but then denies any wrongdoing after you call them out on it, you’re being emotionally abused.  Don’t let them invalidate your emotions, just leave.</span>\n\n**You’re left feeling guilty all the time**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Constantly feeling guilty and not being sure why is a good sign that your partner is making you feel this way on purpose.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If everything that goes wrong is always your fault, or they never take responsibility for their behavior or words, or if they make you feel guilty for spending time with others, your partner is using guilt to emotionally abuse you.</span>\n\n**Their bad moods are your fault, all the time**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">People who enjoy emotionally abusing others are very moody, and all of their bad ones are because of you.  If your partner’s bad days are always your fault, you’re being abused.  Your partner should never hold you accountable for their own problems or troubles in life.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They only do this because they don’t want to take responsibility for where they are in life.</span>\n\n**They’re incredibly jealous**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jealousy is a natural part of most relationships.  However, some types of jealousy are heavier than others.  If you’re flirting with another person in front of them, sure they’re probably going to get mad.  But having your partner blow up on you for something small, like a ‘like’ on a social media photo, is unacceptable.</span>\n\n**They cheat on you or threaten to do so**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">What constitutes cheating is different for every couple, but it should be noted that infidelity, and the threat of infidelity, are forms of emotional abuse.  And some people use these terrible behaviors to control you and punish you.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t let someone dictate the direction of your relationship using a person outside of the relationship.</span>\n\nIf you need help getting out of an abusive relationship and don’t know where to start, call the **[National Domestic Violence Hotline](http://www.thehotline.org/)** at 1-800-799-7233.  Know that you are not alone and people want to

400;">Relationships are no walk in the park, especially when it comes to navigating the differences between signs.  Every relationship needs to have that spark or special quality that keeps the passion and love fueled and burning.  See what your Zodiac sign has to say about your needs in a relationship:</span>\n\n**Aries**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aries needs someone who is direct and up-front about things, as they don’t like to be waiting around on people.  They crave spontaneity and are impatient, so be up-front with them, never hide things from them and you’ll do just fine.</span>\n\n**Taurus**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A Taurus appreciates a gentle lover.  They’re looking for a civilized being who has taste and tact.  Rude words and an uninviting edge will quickly turn them off.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gemini needs to have contact with their lover at least a little bit everyday.  Regardless of medium, communication is key to a lasting relationship with a Gemini.  Don’t be afraid to shoot a quick text over to them for no other reason than you’re thinking about them.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cancer’s needs revolve around protection.  They enjoy feeling that they themselves are protected by their partner and that their partners feel protected by them.  Being greeted with dedication, protection and security is the thing most Cancers want to come home to.</span>\n\n**Leo**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Leo likes to maintain a balance between freedom and extreme affection.  They need to be able to do what they want to do in order to love fully.  They’re playful creatures by nature, having certain childlike ways about them.  But they’re also highly passionate and loving.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virgo doesn’t waste time with anyone who is not legitimately kind.  Competence and kindness rank high in the Virgo’s world, so if you’re trying to get on their good side, take the time to be the caring person they want you to be.  Showing compassion for less fortunate people or creatures goes a long way.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Libra enjoys smooth sailing and steady waters.  Peace and harmony are valued above all else, meaning their partner needs to be patient and accepting.  A Libra is quick to forgive as they appreciate all attempts and see past most shortcomings.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Scorpio values honesty and integrity in their partners.  They’re also drawn toward those they can feel keep a secret.  Also, as they are highly sexual beings, being good in bed also helps lure in a Scorpio.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sagittarius is huge on generosity.  They love people who love to give and receive on a grand scale.  This is true when it comes to good sex as well, always be able to give and receive.  </span>\n\n**Capricorn**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Capricorn is attracted to respect, a strong work ethic and those who are not lazy because they understand that a loving relationship is something that takes time and effort.  They don’t enjoy being taken for granted, but also don’t enjoy being praised too often.</span>\n\n**Aquarius**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aquarius loves exciting and experimental things, but what they value even more is someone who is fair and open-minded.  If their partner complains about petty things in life then there is no chance for them.  They like when their partner agrees with what they have to say.</span>\n\n**Pisces**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Possibly the most sensitive of all the Zodiac signs, the Pisces needs a lover who is both open and sensitive.  They don’t enjoy people whose feelings are constantly hurt and they respond best to the lover that comforts them during times of duress.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relationships are no walk in the park, especially when it comes to navigating the differences

 I’m sure you’d vehemently deny my claim and suggest that it’s actually blue, but what if for me it actually was green?  Maybe my greens are your blues and my yellows are your reds.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember the heart-attack that **[the internet had over the color of a dress](http://www.littlethings.com/what-colors-are-this-dress/)** not too long ago?  Half the population said the dress was white and gold, the other half said it was blue and black.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it turns out that it all has to do with how many color receptors you have in your eyeballs.  [Diana Derval](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/25-people-have-4th-cone-see-colors-p-prof-diana-derval), a neuro-marketing expert, has developed a little test to determine how color-sensitive your eyes are.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">How many of the colors can you find in the box below?</span>\n\n**Count the colors in the box**\n\n![To take the test, count the colors you see in this spectrum:](http://cdn6.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2015/05/d45f74fc-9a3a-48e9-89e2-7f6816afd066-600x315.jpg)\n\n**So, how many were you able to count?**\n\n**Fewer than 20 colors – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">This number represents people who only have two cones in the eye, meaning you’re a dichromat.  Dichromats make up 25 percent of the population, and all dogs are dichromats.  Dichromats like to dress in black, beige and blue colors.</span>\n\n**Between 20 and 32 different colors – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">This group is the trichromats.  You have three types of cones in your eyes, all in the purple/blue, green and red areas.  Derval notes that trichromats see different colors, and that about half of the population are trichromats.</span>\n\n**Between 32 and 39 different colors – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">You guessed it, these people have four cones in their eyes and are known as tetrachromats.  About a fourth of the population has four cones and they cannot stand the color yellow.</span>\n\n**More than 39 different colors – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Think you’re pretty cool, eh?

 Half the population said the dress was white and gold, the other half said it was blue and black.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it turns out that it all has to do with how many color receptors you have in your eyeballs.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/25-people-have-4th-cone-see-colors-p-prof-diana-derval">Diana Derval</a>, a neuro-marketing expert, has developed a little test to determine how color-sensitive your eyes are.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many of the colors can you find in the box below?</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Count the colors in the box</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src="http://cdn6.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2015/05/d45f74fc-9a3a-48e9-89e2-7f6816afd066-600x315.jpg" alt="To take the test, count the colors you see in this spectrum:" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>So, how many were you able to count?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>*Fewer than 20 colors – *</em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This number represents people who only have two cones in the eye, meaning you’re a dichromat.  Dichromats make up 25 percent of the population, and all dogs are dichromats.  Dichromats like to dress in black, beige and blue colors.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Between 20 and 32 different colors – *</em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This group is the trichromats.  You have three types of cones in your eyes, all in the purple/blue, green and red areas.  Derval notes that trichromats see different colors, and that about half of the population are trichromats.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Between 32 and 39 different colors – *</em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You guessed it, these people have four cones in their eyes and are known as tetrachromats.  About a fourth of the population has four cones and they cannot stand the color yellow.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*More than 39 different colors – *</em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think you’re pretty cool, eh?

who are striving to find that special someone to call our own, happiness is at the top of the priority list.  The thing is, being in a relationship where you both have intense feelings for one another often causes us to act and think in ways that we normally wouldn’t.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we’re in love and we’re striving to build a lasting happiness with our significant other, but at the same time we’re also acting a bit crazy because of these strong emotions, and this is where problems arise.  And more often than not, these problems arise because one partner is unknowingly doing things that the other partner doesn’t like.  Because if you knew that you were doing something hurtful toward your significant other, you’d stop right?</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are three mistakes that everyone makes when they’re deep into a relationship:</span>\n\n**Failing to take ownership of problems – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Working hard at a relationship often leads us to believe that things are going well, so when problems comes up or when fights occur, we tend to be left scratching our heads as to what happened.  And then we usually shift blame to our partners, because we’re trying hard, so it can’t be us.  Wrong.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Blaming your partner is the easiest thing to do, but also the absolute worst.  If you find yourself thinking this, take a step back and reflect on the entire situation for a while.  Think critically about what’s really happening and how you play a part in it.</span>\n\n**Taking too much ownership – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, you shouldn’t feel the need to take responsibility for every little thing that goes wrong in the relationship.  Wanting to fix things and bring your relationship back to its former glory is natural, but taking on more than your fair share of the blame is unhealthy and will quickly lead your relationship down a dark path.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure that your relationship is balanced, and that both people are able to recognize when they should be taking responsibility.</span>\n\n**Failing to understand the difference between the two – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to finding this balance in your relationship is know when to stand up for yourself and accept the blame, and knowing when to stand up for yourself when you’re not to blame.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are going to be many situations during the relationship in which you’re going to want to attack your partner and blame everything on them, but you know that isn’t wise.  But you also recognize that your significant other can’t be consistently getting away with crappy behavior.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk with your partner about where you think each of you falls within this spectrum, and really listen to what they have to say.  It might shed some light on a problems you’ve been dealing with.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of us who are in committed relationships or who are striving to find

about like it’s something that is separate from the rest of our being, but the truth is that our souls are our true existence in this world.  When we forget that we are shadows of our souls, we forget what it means to truly be ourselves, where we truly come from and how to be all that we can be.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When this happens, it’s okay, because our souls have got our backs, and they’ll always be there to guide us along by reminding us of these five simple life truths:</span>\n\n**You are where you are supposed to be, do not fret**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re working your way through life, making big decisions, and choosing which paths to take at those monumental forks in the road, your soul knows that regardless of which choices you make, at the end of the day everything happens for a reason.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace where you are at this moment in life and know that everything will work out in the end.</span>\n\n**Acknowledge impermanence**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the greatest lessons to be learned in life is that most everything in life has an expiration date on it.  Just as we are not permanent fixtures on this planet, pretty much everything else is not permanent either.  So, recognize when there is good in your life and when there is bad in your life, and know that neither one will stay with you forever.</span>\n\n**To succeed, you only need look inward**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">People who meditate regularly will tell you that all of your problems can be solved by simply channeling your inner awareness.  When you are down on your luck or struggling to find your stride, look inside and listen to your soul.  It knows that you are strong enough, compassionate and loving enough, and courageous enough to take on any endeavor.</span>\n\n**You’re perfectly okay as you are right now**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Changing who you are for reasons that are not true to yourself is not healthy growth.  Transformation is a choice, but it must come to us organically and from a place of acceptance.  Be content with who you are and your transformative process will occur on its own.</span>\n\n**Self worth is measured by the self**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can look to others for happiness through approval and validation, but true happiness does not lie within others.  Each one of the 7 billion people living on our planet today is unique and complex, and the people in your life are no different.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Striving to make each and every person happy just isn’t a possible goal.  Make yourself happy first and foremost, and then you can start to make others happy.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soul is often talked about like it’s something that is separate from the rest of our being, but the truth is that our souls are our true

trust your gut and go with your instincts, they’ll guide you in the right direction.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gemini dislikes people who are visibly dull or foolish.  Tiny things like grammar and conventional spelling errors grind your gears more than anything and you hate boring people.  The Gemini benefits well from consistent brain-stimulating activities.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The crab hates feeling unsafe or insecure.  So, they like to put up a tough exterior in order to deflect any suspicion that they’re deeply affected by what others say about them or strong criticisms.  Don’t be afraid to let people know how you feel instead of ignoring your feelings.  Breathe deeply, feeling it in your stomach, as that’s where you feel most safe.</span>\n\n**Leo**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Leos stress out a lot when they find themselves out of control and not knowing what to do.  They also hate losing things and not being able to find them.  Love makes the Leo act the most crazy, turning the King of the Jungle into an insecure, mess of a person.  Leos, you just need to accept what is happening in your life, and let it be.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Virgos, in order to reduce the stress in your life, you need to stop thinking so much.  Don’t be afraid to try new things, even though the thought of stepping out of the comfort zone can be terrifying.  Visualize yourself overcoming the obstacles in your life, trust that you’re in the right place and stay positive.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Libras value fairness quite a bit, so when they feel they’re getting the short end of the stick, they’re not at all happy about it.  If you want to confront someone, do it in a calm and composed manner, don’t let yourself brood for days and then blow up on someone.  Keep it sweet and to the point, let people know what your stance is on the matter.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Scorpio is a sensitive being, but they are able to hide it well.  The Scorpio’s strength is subtle, meaning you’re not a fan of loudness or noise and you enjoy having privacy.  Allow people to know your boundaries and needs so that a winning solution for everyone can be reached.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sagittarius hates stagnation, so you’re prone to absolutely hating traffic.  You don’t enjoy any activities where you have to be on your best behavior to please someone else.  Stress in your life derives mainly from work or your partner as they seemingly demand things from your constantly.  Take the time to be outside, so as to free your restless spirit every now and then.</span>\n\n**Capricorn**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Capricorn sets high expectations for itself, and you feel pressure to succeed when you fail to reach your goals.  Never waste your time in self-loathing or deep contemplation about what you could have done different, etc.  Live in the moment and find time everyday to relax and decompress.</span>\n\n**Aquarius**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aquarius often feels pressed for time as there’s simply not enough of it in the day.  They like having things their way and dislike those who try to pressure them into doing things.  If you slow down just a little bit, you’ll find it’s actually easier to accomplish more, and you can be relaxed while doing so.</span>\n\n**Pisces**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pisces is known for being a private creature.  Any situations that leave you feeling vulnerable or exposed will be stressful.  Invasions of privacy or space can leave you feeling ill, as does a loud environment.  Be sure to find time to spend alone, as this will give you the space needed to sort through emotions and conflicts.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><strong>Aries</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You enjoy having tons of Ram energy throughout your day, but as it fades, you find yourself feeling exposed or vulnerable.  The Aries is constantly trying to accomplish all their goals as fast as they can, which is why they often forget to take time out of their day to simply do nothing.  Taking time for yourself is the best way to reduce stress and feel less overwhelmed by all things you want to do.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Taurus</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taurus enjoys doing things smart and right, as the last thing they want is to come off as incompetent.  This can lead you to being anxious about time constraints and deadlines.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also tend to stress about personal conflicts, whether you hurt someone’s feelings or can’t find a resolution to a fight;

at first, Dr. Linda Bender says that telepathy between yourself and animals is possible and she’ll help you do it.  In order to create the space in which one communicates telepathically with an animal, one must first quiet the mind, focus on living presently, and open the heart.  Once you’ve done this, practice doing one or more of the practices below for at least a few minutes a day.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Animals mainly think in pictures and emotions.  So, when they’re trying to connect with you, they’ll often create a mental image or some type of emotion.  Communicating with animals isn’t like talking to a friend over the phone.  You will not ‘hear’ their words, necessarily, but rather different words will manifest in your own mind spontaneously as you receive their thoughts or feelings.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Here are five practices for telepathy with animals:</span>\n\n<span class="s1">**Pictorial Messages**</span>\n\n<span class="s1">When trying to get your animal companion to do something for you, next time try forming a mental image of the action that you want them to do, and then focus on sending that image to them via ‘telepathic airwaves’.  </span>\n\n<span class="s1">Like in those old beer commercials, where the dog fetches a beer for his master out of the fridge, picture them doing whatever it is you want them to do.  You’ll start to notice that they respond to these mental messages.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">**Sending Feelings**</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Similar to the last practice, you’ll be trying to send your emotions or feelings to your animal companion.  To try this, instead of exclaiming ‘good boy!’, practice focusing more on the actual feeling of being happy or satisfied with your companion.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Once you’ve really built up this emotion of being pleased inside of you, send it off to them.  Practicing this will help you both send and receive messages from animals.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">**Make a Metaphor**</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Being able to create different metaphors is vital to understanding metaphors that you might receive from an animal.  Metaphors are mental images that symbolically represent certain feelings, emotions, or ideas.  </span>\n\n<span class="s1">For example, if I’m feeling overwhelmed in life, an image of Atlas holding the Earth on his shoulders might pop into my mind.  Practice creating different mental images of metaphors for the feelings you experience, as animals will often use these to try to speak to you.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">**Send Comfort**</span>\n\n<span class="s1">In the same way that you would send a mental image or a feeling, sending comfort is one of the best ways to get through to an animal telepathically.  Focus on the animal’s suffering and then brainstorm all of the ways you can offer it comfort.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">You can send feelings of being loved or pictures of you soothing them or petting them.  If the animal is near death you might send them images of how happy they’ll be in their new afterlife animal sanctuary.  Gather these thoughts and feelings, prepare them to be sent and then shoot them over to the animal in need.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">**Requests for Help**</span>\n\n<span class="s1">While animals have no way of interpreting any sort of spoken message, they’re very apt at picking up on the emotions and feelings that lie behind them.  When a person asks for help, they typically expect a solution to be given in the form of a spoken answer, “you need to do this.”  Animals will not be able to answer questions like this.  </span>\n\n<span class="s1">Instead, focus on a current problem or concern that you have and then navigate your way through all of the different feelings and emotions that have motivated the question.  Use these feelings to build a statement instead of a question, acknowledge any images that come with it, and then telepathically send that statement (along with any emotions or pictures) to an animal, to yourself, to another person, or to your God.  </span>\n\n \n\n(h/t **[OM

that we neglect and forget to take the time for.  Our homes like to reflect how the rest of our lives are doing, meaning if we’re in a poor place, our homes are likely to be as well.  Don’t let yourself become overwhelmed with negativity.\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try these five easy tips for clearing out the negative energies in your home so you can start living a more positive lifestyle:</span>\n\n**Make your space exist for you**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As time goes by, many of us pick up lots of additional baggage that we might not want in our homes, but feel pressured to keep anyway because they are gifts or hold value for someone else.  If there’s anything in your home that you feel obligated to keep around, get rid of it.  Build a space that features only things that </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> want and like.</span>\n\n**Try clapping in the corners**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stagnant energy is quickly gotten rid of by clapping in the corners of each room you want to affect.  Maybe there are certain spaces in your home that feel naturally depressed or stagnant, clap in their corners until you feel a shift in the energy.</span>\n\n**Fix your broken things**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve stopped using certain items in your home that you used to use all the time, but now can’t because they are broken, take the time to fix them.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can’t afford to fix everything immediately, no worries, just form a plan or have intentions to fix them once you can.  Doing your best always promotes positive energy.</span>\n\n**Fill your kitchen with ‘good’**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same way that your body starts to feel better once you’ve filled it largely with superfoods, nutrients and other healthy substances, your kitchen’s energy will do the same thing if you fill it with the things that are great for you.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock your kitchen with plant-based foods, unprocessed snacks, and pure pantry ingredients, and you’ll notice a huge difference in energy.</span>\n\n**Do everything with love**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is widely believed that love has both effective and universal healing properties, so adding more of it to your life can only benefit you.  The most effective way to keep negative energy out of the home is to take the time to do the activities you love in your home.  It could be a quiet nook for reading, a master chef’s kitchen, or an outside patio that you relax on.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing all of the negative energy from one’s space allows for positive things to grow there instead, like love, peace, fun, health and prosperity.</span>\n\n(h/t**[ Mind Body

#[FreeTheNipple](http://freethenipple.com/) and #[NoBraDay](https://www.awarenessdays.co.uk/awareness-days-calendar/national-no-bra-day/) are meant to empower women all over the world, it turns out that a lot of women actually </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">like</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the function and purpose of the bra.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While most of us are for women gaining equality on the topless front, and [there’s even been some research into why you shouldn’t even be wearing a bra](http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/no-bra-day-special-are-bras-bad-you), a lot of women feel that going without one is impractical.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Women use bras for all sorts of different reasons, from simply keeping them stationary to relieving back pressure to hiding the occasional erect nipple.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to try out something new, something different from your standard bra, check out these five great alternatives:</span>\n\n**The Pasty!**![seashell

At The Metropolitan Opera House At Lincoln Center")\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you want the coverage on your nipples, but also like to feel free and uninhibited.  Pasties come in a variety of different designs, shapes and colors, and use a light adhesive to keep them in place.  They’re also quite festive, meaning you can bust them out for those nights when you need to get creative with a costume.</span>\n\n**Use some tape**\n\n![breast life

the strips come with a guarantee of being able to hold cup sizes A through D.</span>\n\n**No wardrobe malfunctions**\n\n![double

special, double-sided tape can be used when you want to wear something that lets the girls breathe, but you also don’t want to them to pop out unexpectedly.  Low-cut necklines and the gap that forms between shirt buttons can be solved by using this type of bra alternative.</span>\n\n**Sew in some cups**\n\n![Sew in

you just want to ditch the bra for the day.  Stitching in these molded cups to a dress or a top are a great way to give you an extra bit of emphasis on your boobs while also keeping them smooth and

very in-depth and vast collections of crystals.  For them, each crystal has meaning, and many people like to use all of them if they can.  People wear crystals for a variety of different reasons, and as such, each crystal has specific traits and properties.  Some use them for healing, others for protection, and others for relaxation or meditation.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, out of the hundreds of crystals you can choose to wear, there are about seven that cover all the key areas.  They’re inexpensive and easy to procure, meaning everyone should have them!</span>\n\n**Clear Quartz**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This wonderful crystal is a jack-of-all-trades.  It’s widely known for it’s ability to enhance, restore and regulate energies.  It can also help one channel their inner psychic abilities, boost the effectiveness of other crystals, enhance the immune system, as well as re-align our chakras.  </span>\n\n**Amethyst**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Amethyst is used by many for it’s ability to help improve sleep, relaxation, meditation, and the opening of the crown chakra.  Additionally, it helps one to end bad habits

an abundance crystal, this stone helps bring individuals financial stability.  Its ability to balance the solar plexus chakra helps promote an energized will power.  Others like to use it to boost

collections of crystals.  For them, each crystal has meaning, and many people like to use all of them if they can.  People wear crystals for a variety of different reasons, and as such, each crystal has specific traits and properties.  Some use them for healing, others for protection, and others for relaxation or meditation.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, out of the hundreds of crystals you can choose to wear, there are about seven that cover all the key areas.  They’re inexpensive and easy to procure, meaning everyone should have them!</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Clear Quartz</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wonderful crystal is a jack-of-all-trades.  It’s widely known for it’s ability to enhance, restore and regulate energies.  It can also help one channel their inner psychic abilities, boost the effectiveness of other crystals, enhance the immune system, as well as re-align our chakras.  </span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Amethyst</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amethyst is used by many for it’s ability to help improve sleep, relaxation, meditation, and the opening of the crown chakra.  Additionally, it helps one to end bad habits and unhealthy addictions.  In this sense, it brings balance.  However, it also used as a psychic protection

Meaning, if that picture doesn’t include you, they’re not going to keep you around.  “Settling” for a person is not something they’ll do; their partner is their partner because they want it that way and they see a future with that person.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rarely ever will an old soul do something without good reason.</span>\n\nh/t [**Rebel Circus **](http://www.rebelcircus.com/blog/how-the-old-soul-loves-differently/)\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, the ‘Old Soul.’  If you’re an old soul or have a friend who’s one, you know that we’re a little different from everyone else.  For whatever reason, we seem to handle ourselves better around older people and feel that our views on life are a little “before our time.”  This is why we enjoy spending time alone fairly often, because we’re misunderstood by our peers.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that doesn’t mean we’re lonely people.  We’re just capable of enjoying the company we can provide ourselves.  We’re also pretty different when it comes to romance and relationships.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five things to know about how the old soul loves differently:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>They’re homebodies</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homebody is the person who would rather stay in on Friday night instead of going out.  And they’re looking for a partner who shares this sentiment.  Bring over a bottle of wine, maybe some candles, and enjoy a relaxed night of conversation and good company.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Not too concerned with material objects</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old souls are anything but materialistic, so don’t have high expectations for a giant diamond ring or brand new luxury car.  They enjoy expressing their affection through grand gestures that have deeper meaning, like love letters or poems.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Old Souls communicate better than anyone else</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playing games is something that the old soul simply doesn’t entertain when it comes to communication.  They’re going to tell you how they honestly feel, so don’t get caught too off guard by this; they have good intentions at heart.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>They only open up to select people</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old soul is almost incapable of having one night stands, simply because the only people they enjoy sleeping with are those who they’re emotionally invested in.  Sex without emotion, or a deeper connection, is meaningless, so don’t be surprised when they don’t open up immediately.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Everything is done with purpose</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old soul is constantly thinking about the big picture.

about the things that are going on in their lives, so you usually don’t have to worry about them stressing over much.  They like to tell you their fears and it’s easy to tell when they’re scared.  Maybe they like to grab hold of you during new or stressful situations.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While it might seem like you know your child like the back of your hand, they don’t always like to display their anxieties.  Sometimes they’ll keep their fears and anxieties hidden.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five signs to look for if you think your child might be anxious and not telling you:</span>\n\n**Physical Symptoms**\n\n![Anxiety isn't just in the mind, it can be felt in the body as well.](http://blogs.psychcentral.com/anxious-kids/files/2016/03/image.jpeg)\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anxiety has just as much of an effect on the mind as it does the body.  Some common symptoms in anxious children include nauseated stomachs, gastrointestinal problems, chest pains, headaches, and cheek biting to name a few on the long list.  If you’ve taken your child to medical professionals in search of an answer to their ailments, but have found nothing, it might be anxiety.</span>\n\n**They suddenly don’t like school**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your child is suddenly disinterested in school and you’re struggling to even get them there without resistance, anxiety might be to blame.  If they’re consistently feigning sickness only to be completely fine not long after you’ve let them play hookey, anxiety might be to blame.  Look for signs of them being totally fine during the weekends, and symptoms showing up right when school is back in session.</span>\n\n**Anger**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While kids typically experience anger for a variety of different reasons, which can make identifying the sole cause difficult, it could be anxiety that is causing them to reach their boiling point quicker than usual.  If they’re coming home from school with their fuse already lit or bedtime starts becoming a huge hassle, anxiety might be at the root of the issue.  Be observant of when and why they are getting angry.</span>\n\n**They’re avoiding their normal activities**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they’re always trying to stay home instead of going to restaurants or to stores or they’re avoiding activities and situations that they’ve enjoyed in the past, take some time to look into why.  It’s possible that they’ve simply moved on from certain things, but remember that the most common method of coping with anxiety in children is ‘avoidance’.  </span>\n\n**Routines and rituals**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your child is practicing rituals or seeks out certain behaviors from others, like needing to be told “I love you” a certain way or a certain number of times before doing something, then they could be harboring anxiety.  While routines are often comforting and predictable, rituals need to be done to perfection, and need to be redone if they are not done correctly the first time.  Routines can be seen as healthy, while rituals are indicative of anxiety.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think your child might be anxious, the sooner they receive help for the better off they will be.  </span>\n\n(h/t **[Psychcentral](http://blogs.psychcentral.com/anxious-kids/2016/03/missed-signs-child-anxiety/)**)\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children are typically

fifth sign of the Zodiac and many people see them as feisty, over-the-top kind of people.  This is typically due to the highly positive vibes they enjoy putting out, which are often misinterpreted as misplaced energy.  This is not the case, as Leos are some of the strongest and most intelligent individuals you will meet.</span>\n\nThe Leo is highly selective of who they spend their time with, so if you’re one of the lucky few who gets this opportunity, try not to take advantage of it.  Here are five reasons to never take the Leo for granted:\n\n**Leos never chase someone unless they know they’re important – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Leo doesn’t like to date just anyone and they’ll never beg you to stick around.  Having to fight for your attention is not something they enjoy doing.  Once they realize they don’t need you, they’ll stop wasting any time or energy on the relationship.</span>\n\n**When the Leo loves someone, they’re determined and humble – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Leos are some of the most passionate people in the world, and they crave love.  Once they feel that they have secured the loyalty and devotion from their partner they are quick to reciprocate in full.  Trust is always number one on a Leo’s list, so once you’ve gained it, you’ll only receive the same in return.</span>\n\n**Speaking of love, the Leo is highly romantic underneath their strong and independent exterior – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Leo loves to love and loves being loved.  They tend to feel more strongly than their Zodiac peers.  They like their relationships to be meaningful, so they appreciate the small things and spoil those who they care about.</span>\n\n**Leos have an amazing sense of humor – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Leos are often known as the life of the party.  They know exactly how to make people laugh and are excellent at brightening the days of their friends and loved ones.  They enjoy the spotlight and enjoy the positive attention they receive even more.</span>\n\n**Their positivity will soon become your positivity – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being around a Leo makes people just feel good.  Their positive attitude and nothing-is-impossible attitude boosts even the lowest of spirits.  They command great influence on those around them, because their outlook on life is something that everyone strives for.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leos are a unique breed.  They’re the fifth sign of the Zodiac and many people see them as feisty, over-the-top kind of people.  This is

relationship just isn’t heading in the right direction.  Sometimes things are going great when a sudden patch of roughness turns things upside down, leaving the two of you reeling and confused.  It can be hard to tell if you should stick it out or decide to part ways.  But there are little things that let you know the two of you are doing things right.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five ways to tell that you’re in a relationship that’s right for you:</span>\n\n**You have the support of others**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends and family are the ones we turn to for acceptance of our choice in partner because we trust that they only want the best for us, and because they’re outside of the relationship so they can see things a little more clearly.  If your friends and family want to see you and your partner together, there’s something to be said about that.  Don’t get too caught up with what others think, but it is a good sign.</span>\n\n**You guys fight fairly**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good thing if the two of you can have conflicts that do not resort to personal attacks and/or insults.  If your arguments are focused mainly on resolving known issues while still considering each other’s feelings and desires, then it’s a good sign that the two of you are good for each other.</span>\n\n**You’re growing together**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any great relationship is great because there is growth by both people involved.  When the two of you do not inhibit one another’s emotional, mental and spiritual growth, then it’s a good sign that you’re meant to be together.</span>\n\n**You view each other as life partners**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you can’t imagine a life without your significant other it’s very telling of how deeply you care about them.  If you struggle to imagine a world where the two of you aren’t together in some form or another, and know that your partner feels the same way, you’re in the right relationship.</span>\n\n**You’re not interested in another love**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are all types of love in this world, each of them different, you can’t imagine yourself loving anyone but your partner.  Physical attractions will come and go harmlessly as long as we acknowledge them for what they are, and then let them go.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re positive that no other bond in the world can compare to the connection the two of you have, it’s a good sign you’ve found the right relationship.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes it’s easy to tell when a relationship just isn’t heading in the right direction.  Sometimes things are going great when a

it’s how we react, how we compose ourselves during these times that come to define our true character.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we find ourselves in these unfortunate situations, we can let them take hold of us and destroy us, or we can use them to fortify ourselves, to bolster our being.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">These five forgotten truths are empowering–they’ll help you remain strong and wise during troubled times.</span>\n\n**Pain is a natural part of life, it helps you grow**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It could be argued that pain is </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> most natural part of human life.  But without pain, we would not have growth.  Pain shows us what we are truly capable of overcoming, it wakes us up to our truest of feelings.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, embrace pain, embrace your scars and wounds as you move forward and flourish into the truest version of yourself.</span>\n\n**Change your perspective, change your world**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe life is good, then life is good.  If you believe life is bad, then life is bad.  You can be happy if you want to be, as being happy is a skill, one that many people learn to master slowly over their lives.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They take nothing for granted, treat every day as a gift, and never let anything bitter take away from anything sweet.</span>\n\n**A large part of growth happens through experience**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A great lesson in life is learning to never assume or expect anything, because life often has other plans.  And what you gain from these ‘other’ plans, is experience.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience is incredibly valuable, it gives us strength, wisdom, and courage.  Know that all of your experiences up to this point have prepared you for everything that has yet to come.</span>\n\n**You only have to live in the present**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While most of us often get caught up living in some idealistic future, or terrifying past, life is lived in the passing seconds of each moment of each day.  To achieve any sort of goal or vision of tomorrow, the work has to be put in today.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t get caught up on where you think you should be–you are exactly where you need to be right now, and it’s going to take you to where you want to be in the future.</span>\n\n**You will never find true validation from other people**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most empowering truths of life is that we do not exist in this world for other people.  You do not owe anyone anything, so never feel like you have to live your life according to anyone but yourself.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you seek status, wealth and fame, or solitude, peace and quiet, it is your decision, no one else’s.  Define success for yourself, and then succeed.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nature of life is simply that there will be good times and there will undoubtedly be bad times;

This Might Be Why	waking-up-at-the-same-time-every-night-this-might-be-why	\n<span class="s1">If you’ve noticed that you’re waking up at a specific time every night, it could mean that your body is trying to tell you something.  The energy meridians of the body have been said to be connected to a clock system that stimulates different parts of the body at different times of the day.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">The time at which you find yourself waking up (or having trouble sleeping) can mean a variety of different things:</span>\n\n<span class="s1">**Between 9pm and 11pm**</span>\n\n<span class="s1">If you struggle to fall asleep during what is considered bedtime for most people it is a sign that you’re still carrying the stresses and anxieties of the day with you.  Meditation, positive mantras, and practicing relaxation techniques or exercises can help you fall asleep and stay asleep.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">**Between 11pm and 1am**</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Ancient Chinese medicine would say that between these hours the energy meridian of the gallbladder is stimulated.  If you’re waking up at this time, you might be suffering from emotional disappointment.  Try to promote self-love and forgiveness to get back to sleeping normally.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">**Between 1am and 3am**</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Waking up during this interval of time is associated with the body clock and our livers.  It can mean that you’re harboring emotions of anger or that you have an excess of yang energy.  Taking responsibility of the events that caused the anger can help you to sleep better through the night.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">**Between 3am and 5am**</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Struggling to sleep between 3am and 5am is correlated with the energy meridian that flows through the lungs and can be because of emotional sadness.  Slow, deep breathing exercises and expressions of faith in your higher being will help you fall back asleep.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">**Between 5am and 7am**</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Waking during this time is associated with the energies in the intestines.  Stretching your muscles and taking a bathroom break can help clear emotional blockages and get you back to sleep.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Remember to listen to your body and what it has to say to you.  It is often during the sleep cycle that we are most likely to experience spiritual events and messages.  Just as our thoughts manifest physical side effects on the body, our spirituality does the same.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span

through this journey called life we will allow a number of different people to come into our lives, whether it be as friends, business partners, lovers, or whatever else.  And there will also be those that enter our lives and immediately start causing trouble.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have time to keep these types of people around, as they’ll only hold you back in life.  You need people in your life who are going to help you grow, help you love, help you flourish.  </span>\n\nHere are four types of negative people that you don’t need in your life:\n\n**The User**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A person with this type of personality is highly egotistical.  They’re masters of manipulation and deception and have zero remorse for those that they afflict.  They’re quick to feed on people who are kind and sensitive, as they’re the easiest to use and abuse.  They’ll often leave your life in ruins, as if they were some sort of natural catastrophe.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To deal with this type of person, do not engage with their drama-creating antics, be assertive and don’t be afraid to say ‘no’ with confidence.</span>\n\n**The Gossiper**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever had to deal with a person who gossips and spreads rumors, then you’ve met a person with extremely low self-esteem and plenty of insecurities.  They like to twist context, omit certain details, and embellish the truth for a variety of reasons, including popularity, revenge, control, power and just plain boredom.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do your best to avoid getting caught up in their stories, and don’t be afraid to call them out when they start gossiping.</span>\n\n**The Blamer**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blamer is a person who feels largely victimized every time something undesirable happens.  They hate taking responsibility for anything and are quick to pass off the blame to someone else, even if it means going to extreme measures.  This shows their innate lack of self-control and self-esteem.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When dealing with this type of person be sure to control the conversation.  Question everything and be sure that they know they’re going to be held accountable.</span>\n\n**The Complainer**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Complainer is the person you always see moping about feeling sorry for themselves.  And they like to divert attention to themselves by spreading negativity.  These people can be hard to deal with because of their strange demeanor.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing to do is to be supportive while abstaining from any engagement of the issue or story that they’re pushing.  Completely detach yourself from the situation while acknowledging their plight.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we progress through this journey

their way into our lives for a variety of different reasons, and a lot of the time we’re completely unaware of these reasons.  You might be attracting toxic people without even knowing it.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five ways you might be unintentionally bringing toxic people into your life:</span>\n\n**You like to be a good listener**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a good listener is not a bad trait to have, but it invites toxic people into our lives when they see it as an opportunity to talk at us for hours about themselves.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They like to ignore the subtle gestures you give indicating that you’re done because they’re not too concerned with what you have to say or think in the first place.  Active listeners are often targets of the narcissistic.</span>\n\n**You’re generous**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Generosity is undoubtedly a good trait to have, but toxic people are very attracted to generous folks, mainly because they know that they can use you to their gain.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They like to hang around in your life because they know they can count on you to do the things they want you to do.</span>\n\n**You’re open and trusting**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you soar like an eagle, you attract hunters.  Dreaming big and striving to achieve your goals is a simple way to gain the attention of toxic people.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They fear your success, and will do anything to inhibit it.  Never open up to people who have shown that they are close-minded or poisonous.</span>\n\n**You have an easy-going personality**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy-going people are fun to be around because they not aggressive, choosing patience and kindness during times of trouble of conflict.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">An easy-going person is the perfect target for the malicious intent of a toxic person seeking to take that easy-going-ness away from them.  They see this way of being as weakness and something to be taken advantage of.</span>\n\n**You strive to see the good in everyone**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving people the benefit of the doubt is often a double-edged sword, but we do it anyway because we like to believe that people are inherently good.  And most of the time people live up to this expectation, but every so often we come across an individual that challenges our beliefs.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to see only the good in people can lead us down dark paths, like when we hold onto relationships thinking that a toxic person will change, even though they continue to put us down and do things to hurt us.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toxic people make their way into our lives for a variety of different reasons, and a lot of the time we’re completely unaware of

cultures and societies around the world, sensitive people are tagged with labels like ‘weak’ or ‘unworthy,’ which I think is a very flawed way of thinking.  Being capable of deep, sincere emotion and thought cannot be described as a weakness or vice.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We should never be afraid to say what we are feeling, whether it be bad or good.  And bottling up emotions isn’t good for anyone.  It leads to isolation and thoughts that you are alone.  You’re not alone.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychotherapist and researcher, Dr. Elaine Aron, says that 15 to 20 percent of people have nervous systems that process stimuli more intensely than the average.  Not only do they feel more, but they think more deeply, leading to quick overstimulation.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five tips for the highly sensitive person:</span>\n\n**There is nothing that will ‘fix’ you**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensitivity is largely a trait of one’s temperament, not some sort of medical condition.  Because of this, you can’t really say that anything is wrong with you.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While many doctors and medical professionals might say otherwise, processing sensitivity research is young and undeveloped.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensitive people that achieve great things do so because they understand that they are not ‘flawed.’</span>\n\n**Look for other sensitive people like yourself**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being highly sensitive often makes you feel like you’re alone in your struggles, when that notion couldn’t be further from the truth.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for other sensitive people who are already succeeding in their endeavors, as they can offer firsthand knowledge of the things you deal with regularly.</span>\n\n**Strive to find positivity in every encounter or situation you find yourself in**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly sensitive people are much more capable of soaking up the energy of their surroundings, meaning negative environments promote negativity and positive environments promote positivity.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best tactics a sensitive person can learn is how to acknowledge negativity and then let go of it.</span>\n\n**Give yourself the same compassion that you give others**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly sensitive people are known for their immense passion.  This often takes the form of them putting the needs and desires of others over their own, while also being highly critical of themselves.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always be willing to give yourself the same leniency and compassion that you want others to have.</span>\n\n**Do your best not to suffocate your sensitivity**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the easiest things to do is tune out the overwhelming amount of stimuli so that you can appear as though it doesn’t affect you on a deeper level, and this is a very unhealthy practice.  While it might trick your mind for a short time, your sensitive self knows better.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The sensitive person needs to learn how to free themselves of the constant need for control, so that you can use this energy on other things, like creativity, empathy and happiness.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oftentimes in cultures and societies around the world, sensitive people are tagged

been the victim or subject of the manipulation tool known as ‘gaslighting,’ then you know just how awful it can truly be.  While this tactic is largely described as “sophisticated,” it only takes on this label because of how truly insane it really is.  It is used by malicious personality types to manifest fear and doubt in the minds of others.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the people that use it, how it works and what you should be looking out for:</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The term ‘gaslighting’ actually **[comes from a 1930s film](http://www.theearthchild.co.za/gaslighting-as-a-manipulation-tactic-what-it-is-who-does-it-and-why/)** in which a scheming husband tries to get rid of his wife by slowly making subtle changes to her environment (including dimming the flame on a gas lamp slightly over time) to make her think that she’s losing her mind.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is now used to describe a similar process often practiced by sociopaths, narcissists and psychopaths who seek to build up so much doubt in a person’s mind that this victim starts to believe that they cannot trust their own judgments, decisions or thoughts anymore, and thus starts to look to the psychopath for answers.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaslighting is often paired with other destructive tactics, like guilting and shaming.  It is achieved in a variety of different ways, like when a person states a major lie with such conviction that the victim questions their perception of reality.  Similarly, they’ll often deny events or experiences ever happened with an intense and determined fervor.  They like to use historical facts that sound accurate, but then tweak them slightly to favor their argument or to seem credible.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The types of people that use these tactics are mainly focused on establishing and maintaining a position of leverage or advantage over their victims.  And this is achieved when the victim starts doubting their own perception of reality as they continue to be unable to find strong evidence that the psychopath is purposely disadvantaging them.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully this information helps you to recognize when someone is trying to gaslight you so you can put an end to it as soon as you can.  Remember that there is no room in your life for toxic people, the last thing you want is someone who constantly makes you second-guess yourself and makes you feel like the world around you is not actually as it seems.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever been the victim or subject of the manipulation tool known as ‘gaslighting,’ then you know just how awful

heard of pink Himalayan salt before, maybe you use it religiously, either way, the benefits of this magnificent mineral are astounding and everyone deserves to be educated on the matter.  The

mainstream culture not that long ago, with many people claiming that a sensitivity to gluten, a protein that is found in wheat, barley, and rye, causes them to suffer gastrointestinal problems, joint pain, fatigue, and even depression.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While some have written the condition off as simply a new fad among dieters and nutritionists, it is very real.  In fact, celiac disease, which is the most serious type of gluten intolerance, **[occurs in 1 out of every 100 people](https://celiac.org/celiac-disease/what-is-celiac-disease/)** across the globe.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five signs that you have a gluten intolerance:</span>\n\n**Unexpected weight gain**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve suddenly packed on some pounds without any changes to diet or exercise, you might be gluten intolerant.  Weight gain from a gluten intolerance happens because of two reasons: malabsorption and gut permeability (two side effects of gluten intolerance), and the onset of systemic inflammation, which is caused by gluten.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid gluten for a while and see if your weight goes back to normal.</span>\n\n**Headaches and Migraines**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Migraines and headaches have been found to be much more common in those who are gluten intolerant.  In fact, a study looking at a gluten sensitive group of people found that 56 percent of them suffered from chronic headaches and migraines, compared to 14 percent of the control group.</span>\n\n**Fatigue / Exhaustion**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While research regarding the effect that gluten has on fatigue and exhaustion is scarce, many medical professionals believe that a gluten intolerance can cause these effects through inflammation and de-allocation of the body’s energy reserves.</span>\n\n**Skin Problems**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Skin problems can arise from a gluten intolerance because of its aforementioned malabsorption traits that affect various different areas of our bodies.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">**[Gluten has been correlated](http://www.coreonehealth.com/gluten-sensitivity-and-female-hormones)**with acne, psoriasis, eczema, and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH).  Symptoms can include burning sensations, redness,

Gastroenterology</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> found a link between gluten sensitivity and “aphthous stomatitis,” which is a condition that exhibits recurring mouth ulcers and canker sores.

which makes breaking up that much harder.  You’re not one to outwardly express the pain you’re feeling because you don’t like feeling vulnerable, so you stay busy and speak only to those who are close to you.</span>\n\n**Pisces**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re likely to fully embrace the sadness and sorrow accompanied with most breakups, but you do so because you are not worried about being vulnerable or showing ‘weakness.’  You know that to fully heal you must finish your grieving.</span>\n\n**Aries**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Aries gets hurt, they tend to look to their friends for support because of how social and outgoing they are.  Aries like to stay busy when they’re hurting; this lets them cover their pain with work and activities, pretending as if it hasn’t phased them.</span>\n\n**Taurus**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taurus struggles at times to adequately express how they’re feeling and what they’re thinking.  You’re quick to be set off as you occasionally let your emotions flare up, but you have only kindness in your heart, and want someone who loves as deeply as you do.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gemini tend to live in the moment, so a failed relationship or parting of ways is simply water under the bridge.  They like to focus on what’s happening </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">now</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">, instead of what happened yesterday.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancers fall back on their career or work during times of emotional duress because they are natural leaders and enjoy working.  You like to hide your sensitive side, not letting your personal life and work life intersect.  And your friends are always the focus after a heartbreak.</span>\n\n**Leo**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Leos are traditionally both loyal and faithful people, enjoying passionate relationships with their partners.  Because of this, they are often shocked when their partner wishes to separate.  Leos will undoubtedly be hurt, but are also very understanding, wishing their partners the best as they move in a different direction.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Virgos struggle to commit to one person, meaning they take breakups pretty hard.  But that doesn’t mean they’ll stay down for long.  They’re usually the first ones to be back in the dating scene, doing their best to move on–which they will.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The usually optimistic and upbeat Libra doesn’t stay hurt for long.  You might even be willing to stay friends with your former partner.  You will most likely spend most of your time with friends and family after a heartbreak.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scorpios are quick to become reclusive, wanting to deal with their emotions by themselves.  They don’t like others seeing how hurt they are, so they simply pretend that they’re not.  You’ll likely try to stay busy to avoid thinking about it.  Scorpios are very difficult to love, but they are also the most sensitive.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sagittarius, being the carefree and lighthearted creatures that they are, tend to shrug off most breakups or separations.  That’s because the easiest way to deal with anything is to laugh, even when things are tough or sad.  But it’s a trait that the next person will absolutely love.</span>\n\n**Capricorn**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Capricorns take time to let people into their lives, but it’s always worth it because they are the best people to love.  Anyone who has broken up with you will come to regret it.  The Capricorn simply needs to give him or herself time to heal after a nasty breakup, even if it might take a lot of it.</span>\n\nh/t [**Puckermob**](http://www.puckermob.com/relationships/the-ways-you-deal-with-heartbreak-based-on-your-zodiac-sign)\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re going through a tough time and have had to separate from your partner recently, you might be left feeling lost and confused.  Heartbreak affects everyone differently, and your zodiac sign has a lot to do with that.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a bit of insight as to how each sign handles the pain of heartbreak, so that you might grow a little easier:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Aquarius</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting close to people is difficult for you, so when you do fall, you fall hard;

style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a dog owner then you know just how rewarding it can be.  Dogs are known as “man’s best friend” for a reason, because they’ve been our trusted sidekicks for as long as we can remember.  And as it turns out, all of the time that we’ve spent together over the centuries has led to dogs developing unique and subtle ways of expressing their love for us.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While we might not be able to communicate with them like Doctor Dolittle, we will at least know when they’re feeling loved and want to give some love back.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ways that they express their love are not always obvious, but we’ll discuss at least five different practices they like to do to show their human companions love and support:</span>\n\n**Staring straight into your eyes**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">60 Minutes </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">segment featuring well-known dog expert, Brian Hare, when dogs look you in the eye, they’re actually “hugging you with [their] eyes.”  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you and your buddy are playing together or having a nice cuddle session, the same hormone that helps mothers and babies bond, oxytocin, is released in the dog’s brain.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try keeping eye consistent eye contact with them as you go about your normal daily routine with them, but do not actively stare them down, as it will only make them feel uncomfortable.</span>\n\n**Sharing yawns**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know that yawning is one of the most contagious things in the world, but what you might not have known is that it’s not limited to humans.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogs have been bred by humans to understand humans, so when you yawn, your doggy companion will likely reciprocate the gesture.</span>\n\n**Leaning on you**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogs like to lean on their companions for a variety of reasons, like anxiety or wanting you to do something or take them somewhere, but it is also used to express affection. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if anxiety is the sole reason they’re leaning on you, they’re doing this because they recognize you as a source of protection and safety.</span>\n\n**Sleeping in your room**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take note of where your buddy likes to sleep.  If your dog likes to catch his Z’s in your bed, even when you’ve told him numerous times that he’s not allowed up there, it’s only because he loves you.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Gregory Berns, a dog sleeping in your bed is indicative of a strong sense of loyalty, as they fear being separated from the pack.</span>\n\n**Bringing you their favorite toy**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though wanting to play is a sign of affection in and of itself, many dogs aren’t bringing you their prized toy because they want to play.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s usually because they want to please you and think that you’ll enjoy it just as much as they do!</span>\n\nShare this information with all of your friends and family members who love dogs so they can recognize when they’re being

for fighting for the things it values and desires, meaning that if they’ve chosen you, they’re entirely dedicated.  They’re the perfect partners in a relationship, and here are five reasons why:</span>\n\n**Their love is like no other love you’ve ever experienced**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll quickly learn that you’ll have a hard time trying not to fall for the Taurus fast and hard.  Their passion and sympathy shows how colorful and caring they are, illustrating their deep commitment to the people they choose to keep in their life.  They always go the extra mile to make their partners feel loved.</span>\n\n**They want to really *****know***** you**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taurus excels in figuring out what makes people get excited, whatever it may be.  They’re genuinely interested in what’s happening in your life, meaning it can be hard to hide things as they are very observant.  If you’re having an off day, they’ll pick up on it instantly.</span>\n\n**They’re beyond loyal**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a Taurus finds his or herself in a committed relationship, they’re in it for the long haul.  Devotion is no trouble for the Taurus and they’re the best at following through on promises.  Their passion comes out once they feel safe and secure in a relationship, so give and you shall receive.</span>\n\n**They feel *****everything***\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taurus are not typically fake or phony people, as they value being genuine to those around them.  They often love deeply, meaning they’ll show their love interest tremendous kindness and generosity.  However, taking advantage of the Taurus’ love and kindness will quickly give them reason to leave.  They can get sensitive at times, but reassuring them that things will turn out alright will rest their troubled minds.</span>\n\n**They love intimate relationships**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Taurus, love is a powerful thing.  And they love to attach meaning and significance to the events that happen in their life.  If you find yourself loving a Taurus, know that they’ll likely want to see how far you two can go.  They want to build a lasting and memorable bond that revolves around loving and being loved.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taurus is known for fighting for the things it

 But maybe finding true love and then building a lasting love is the first step in this process.  If we can do this, then maybe we can start looking outward, seeking ways to help the world come together in love.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love is one of the most highly sought after things in the world, so much so that people often act crazy or entirely unlike themselves when they’ve fallen for someone.  People of all ages want to find love, yet we see an astonishing number of relationships and marriages that fall apart over time.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the five stages of love and why most people end up calling it quits after stage three:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 1 – Falling in love</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve never fallen in love before, give it a shot sometime.  It’s one of the craziest experiences that you’ll ever forget.  Falling in love is great for many reasons, but mostly because our brains get flooded with chemicals that are designed to make us feel amazing.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, testosterone and estrogen are all swirling together to give us butterflies.  When you’re in love, no one call to you otherwise, because you’re 100% certain of the way you’re feeling.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 2 – Coming together as a couple</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During stage two, the love between two individuals becomes deeper and a little more mature.  This is the stage when most people want to have children and rear them together, as their bond becomes strengthened.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The individuals start making decisions based around the couple, rather than the individual.  Most people feel that this is the love that will last a lifetime, and they are often the same people that are so taken aback by stage three.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 3 – Becoming disillusioned</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage three often throws people for a loop because this is the time when one or both people start feeling uncertain about the direction that their relationship is headed.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage three is when things start to feel wrong.  You become resentful and angry over the littlest things, you feel less loved and intimate, and you want out.  You want to bring back that spark or chemistry, but you’re unsure of how to do it.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting through stage three can be very difficult, but if the couple can survive it, they’ll come out on the other side stronger and more in love than ever.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 4 – Building a real, lasting love</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can make it through stage three, then stage four is your reward.  Stage four takes place after you’ve gotten to the core of all the pain and conflict and are now working to resolve it.  And part of resolving your issues is understanding that everyone is wounded on some level, and that these wounds play a large role in your relationships.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, ongoing research by The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study has shown that childhood trauma can affect our physical, emotional, and relational health in profound ways.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a lasting love means wanting to grow and help each other heal your wounds.  Once the two of you start to heal, you’ll notice the chemistry and feelings of true love start to flourish again.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 5 – Using your love to take on the world</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is often seen as a pretty terrible place and for the most part, it is.  Thinking about the endless amount of conflict and turmoil that plagues every region of the planet can be disheartening; it makes us feel like there’s really nothing we can do individually to help out.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a lasting love between just two people is incredibly hard as it is, how can we do that with 7 billion people?

There’s a large difference between being a person who intimidates people and having a personality that people perceive as intimidating. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rude, domineering, crass.. These are all words that people use to describe people with strong personality types. While I can’t speak for everyone, I can say that most strong personality types that get labeled this way don’t understand it, because on the inside, they’re big softies.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only difference between them everyone else is that they’re completely self-reliant when it comes to validation, they aren’t super competitive, and they’re not about to let anyone mistake them for a pushover.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound familiar? Here are five signs that you have a strong, or “intimidating” personality type:</span>\n\n**You don’t have time for excuses**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As people who strive to do their best and accomplish their goals by overcoming the obstacles that are before them, strong personalities are entirely uninterested in excuses. They hate hearing people whine, because they know that energy could be better spent figuring out how to achieve. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While others are worrying about all of the reasons they </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">can’t</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> do something, you’re focused on all of the ways you </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>\n\n**You’re highly selective when it comes to letting people in**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong people are very sure that they can handle anything life throws their way. This means that their validation and self-confidence comes from within. When you’re not interested in people telling you how to live your life, who you are and what you’re capable of, you start to do all of that for yourself. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this happens, the need for significant others, best friends, family, coworkers, etc. starts to wane, simply because you don’t need anyone but yourself.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Weaker personality types like having others around to make their lives feel validated. They like having people constantly reaffirming their life choices. You recognize that you’re not this way, but that others might need it, and that’s totally fine with you. </span>\n\n**Attention is something you could do without**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While some might think you adore having the spotlight on yourself, they couldn’t be more wrong. The truth is that strong personalities are naturally magnetic, they attract people. Usually because others need a strong personality type to lean on. They want to have you around.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, don’t be afraid to say no to social invitations. You need downtime to recharge and rejuvenate just like everyone else. Make sure your needs are being met, just as you are helping others’ needs to be met.</span>\n\n**You view ‘fear’ differently**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people probably see you as a fearless person, and you’ll let them believe that, because while you definitely feel fear in certain situations, you never let it stop you from moving forward. That is the big difference that people often fail to recognize. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not going to let fear run your life; you’re going to feel that fear and then use it as fuel.</span>\n\n**You cannot tolerate intolerant people**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong personality types hate being thought of as domineering because they know that domineering personalities are born from lack of knowledge or education. Strong people are the opposite of that. They enjoy using their brains and often think of themselves are fairly intellectual beings.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it makes sense that they absolutely cannot stand people who make instantaneous judgments or criticisms on subjects that they have </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">zero</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> experience with. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t talk just to hear yourself talk, so unless you have something important to add to the conversation, you’re not going to.

Being alone because you have no one who cares to spend time with you is not such a great thing.  Enjoying some ‘me time’ is always great.  You get to do the things you love and make you happy.  But you also love being with people who make you happy.  Which makes being lonely the worst, as you have neither of these things.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You always hear about people getting labeled as either ‘extroverted,’ meaning they’re outgoing, spontaneous, social-loving people, or ‘introverted,’ which means pretty much the exact opposite.  Introverts are the people who prefer alone-time to social-time.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, if you’re like me and feel that neither of those categories describe you, then you might fall somewhere in between.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are four things that only us introverted extroverts will truly understand:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Talking to strangers is fine, small talk is not</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holding a conversation hasn’t ever been a problem for you, but when the conversation lulls into anything other than deep and engaging stimulus, you’re quick steer it back in the right direction.  Small talk is fine and all, but you don’t get to know a person through small talk.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>If you’re uncomfortable in a group, you quietly sink into the background</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being in a highly social setting with lots of people is fine for you, when you know them.  But being around a group of folks that are different than what you’re used to can make you feel awkward and anxious, so you tend to stay quiet and go with the flow rather than try to make an impact.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re constantly in your head</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The introverted extrovert’s brain is constantly churning, thinking about seemingly random things that largely have nothing to do with what’s happening in the moment.  It could be something that’s happening next week or something you forgot to do at home, or even some other, entirely fantastical daydream.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Liking alone-time doesn’t mean you enjoy being lonely</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being alone by choice is a great thing.

It makes sense though, doesn’t it? The universe will always influence who we are as people. Just as the Cancer will always be loving and caring, and the Leo proud and passionate.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to find love, learning a bit about what your sign desires in a partner might just be the difference between a lasting, loving relationship, and a drama-filled nightmare.</span>\n\n\n## **Aries (March 21-April 19)**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a youthful fire sign, Aries have a fervent energy and enthusiasm for life. Your leadership skills often let you control the flow of any relationship, which is good because you’re usually the one who is down-to-earth and level-headed. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try not to put the cart before the horse, and people will flock to your ever burning flame.</span>\n\n\n## **Taurus (April 20-May 20)**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taurus have a weak spot for physical intimacy. When the physical side of a relationship picks up heavy and fast, you’re likely to start falling in love at the same time. This is largely because of how in tune you are sensually with your body.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you do find yourself in a faithful relationship, you’re happy just ebbing and flowing within it. Which is why your dream is to settle down together somewhere remote and secluded.</span>\n\n\n## **Gemini (May 21-June 20)**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart, funny and always looking on the bright side, Gemini always make great partners. They’re full of unique and intelligent ideas. They’re also incredibly romantic, which means they often fall in love and stay in love when they adore their partner. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While you might want nothing more than to be with your significant other 24/7, it is good to remember to give each other space, and to communicate with each other as much as possible.</span>\n\n\n## **Cancer (June 21-July 22)**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While Cancers tend to fall face first into love (and hard), they keep a bit of reserved skepticism. You’re searching for someone who will be your ‘partner,’ in every sense of the word. Which is why they prefer partners who are ambitious and motivated.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve found a partner, you’re their number one fan. And your superb listening skills and sense of humor will keep them around for years to come.</span>\n\n\n## **Leo (July 23-August 22)**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Leos are so charismatic, confident and warm, they rarely struggle to find love. But there natural ability to attract others doesn’t keep them from being completely loyal once they’ve fallen for someone. And they tend to fall in love often, and hard. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Leo, you are naturally territorial, but it’s only because of how intense your love is. You need a bit of praise and adoration here and there to keep you happy.</span>\n\n\n## **Virgo (August 23-September 22)**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Virgos sometimes forget just how easy to love they really are. And they don’t like to show any sort of vulnerability. These two notions combined mean that they typically prefer to operate under jealousy and accusations, rather than playing it cool like they so often want to do. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t let yourself become consumed by the idea of love. You need to give people the chance to love you.</span>\n\n\n## **Libra (September 23-October 22)**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Libras are naturally independent and ambitious, which means that love is just another thing in this world that they can choose to pursue, or not pursue. This also means that when they do pick a partner, they’re nothing short of the high standards that have been set. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your high levels of self-respect often have you forcing partners to wait some time before you actually commit to anything.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve found love, your focus will shift toward stability within the relationship.</span>\n\n\n## **Scorpio (October 23-November 21)**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa, watch out, the Scorpio is coming through. Passionate, sexual, stubborn and intense, the Scorpio likes to follow the heart, rather than the brain. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Love is highly valued by Scorpios, and they’re used to getting their way, so their relationships often include a good bit of drama. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Calm and rational partners are perfect for the Scorpio; you fit best with Pisces or Cancer.</span>\n\n\n## **Sagittarius (November 22-December 21)**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the ultimate free-spirit, Sagittarius like to treat love like a journey, one that they’re not afraid to embark on. When it comes to matters of the heart, you enjoy throwing inhibition to the wind, jumping head-first into love.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, your intellectual nature attracts similar-minded partners, ones that share your enthusiasm for novelty experiences and seeing the world.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as you want, you will likely find a partner who’s just as afraid of settling down as you are.</span>\n\n\n## **Capricorn (December 22-January 19)**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Capricorns like having something to work on. This is easy for them when it comes to relationships because they’re really good at seeing big-picture type of stuff. A happy, stable life with the person that they love and call their best friend is something to work toward. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re quite serious when it comes to life, so you expect your partner to be as well. Reckless, crazy passion has no place in your world.</span>\n\n\n## **Aquarius (January 20-February 18)**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aquarius, your big heart often reflects the type of love you desire most: passionate, intense, hot and long-lasting. If you find yourself in love with someone, don’t be afraid to be the selfless person you are. Enjoy devoting time and energy to your relationship without playing games.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll know when you’ve found the right person, because you’ll never want to let go once you do.</span>\n\n\n## **Pisces (February 19-March 20)**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pisces, one of the things you fear most is missing out on your chance to fall in love. You’re highly sensitive, which means your moods can be somewhat polarized at times. Good things in your relationship have you feeling happy, euphoric and carefree, while the bad things often ruin your entire day.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your naturally sweet and caring nature is redeeming, however, as you often put your partner’s needs before your own. Just remember not to sacrifice too much of your own life for the sake of theirs.</span>\n\nh/t [**EliteDaily**](http://elitedaily.com/dating/zodiac-sign-says-love/1267932/)\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falling in love is different for everyone, and our zodiac signs have a lot to do with how it happens.

Just remember not to sacrifice too much of your own life for the sake of theirs.</span></p>\n\n<p>h/t <a href="http://elitedaily.com/dating/zodiac-sign-says-love/1267932/"><strong>EliteDaily</strong></a></p>	http://cdn.heartcenteredrebalancing.com/2016/08/feature_image_lovetemplate.jpg	f	f	published	en_US	public	\N	\N	1	2016-08-05 07:40:37+00	1	2016-08-05 07:40:37+00	1	2016-08-05 07:40:37+00	1

style="font-weight: 400;">Sugar has been a pretty hot topic in popular culture as the United States continues to be one of the most overweight and unhealthy countries in the world.  The **[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](http://www.niddk.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx)** reports that more than two in three adults are considered to be overweight or obese, more than one in three adults are considered to be obese, and about one out of every twenty adults are considered to have extreme obesity.</span>\n\nI hope everyone recognizes this as a problem.  **[Two-thirds of our population is at risk for major health problems](http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/overweight-obesity-statistics.aspx)**, and we’ve all but identified the major culprits.  The main one is sugar.  Consumption of high-sugar content drinks and beverages is a major contributor to the obesity epidemic.  Your average 20-ounce soda has anywhere from **[15 to 18 teaspoons of sugar in it, and around 240 calories](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/sugary-drinks-fact-sheet/)**.  It’s basically liquid candy, except you don’t feel as “full” after drinking it.\n\n**Here are four things that happen to your body when you quit sugar:**\n\n**You gain energy – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">The more sugar you consume, the more inhibited your body’s ability to sustain energy at maximum levels becomes.  When this happens, our blood sugar levels become imbalanced.  Compared to a person who consumes sugar regularly, those who do not consume sugar benefit from improved ability to generate and store energy.  These people tend to eat foods that are high in energy content, but low in sugar content.</span>\n\n**Your weight stabilizes – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re consuming sugar on a regular basis, you’re going to gain weight and there’s no getting around it.  Especially in grown adults, sugar has been seen as directly correlated with extreme weight gain and increased risk of chronic illness.  You often hear of “beer bellies” because, well, they’re actually a thing.  Beer contains a high amount of sugar, which causes fat to build up around our tummy area.  When we quit sugar, our bodies equalize and find a natural balance.</span>\n\n**You reduce your risk for chronic illness – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">**[Diabetes is one of the most common chronic illnesses](http://www.diabetes.org/)** that is associated with obesity and unhealthy weight.  It’s main contributor is, unsurprisingly, sugar.  What’s even worse is that Diabetes can serve as a form of gateway illness, opening up the floodgates for other chronic illnesses that are at their strongest when the immune system is weak.  Quitting sugar entirely gives one the opportunity to live a chronic-illness-free life.</span>\n\n**You’ll start disliking sugar – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugar is just like any other chemical in that when you abuse it, your body becomes addicted to it.  Alcohol, tobacco, methamphetamines, uppers, downers, you name it, if you consume them in large quantities and often, your body will crave it.  While just the opposite is true as well: if you stop consuming something altogether, your craving for that substance disappears.  So, do yourself a favor and quit sugar

1405	9d8fd782-fc8f-4402-a6cb-2059920bca3c	Research Says: Women Need More Sleep Than Men Because of Their Complex Brains	research-says-women-need-more-sleep-than-men-because-of-their-complex-brains	\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting to sleep in is one of the greatest joys in this world.  Waking up, knowing that you can start your day whenever you please is an indulgence that I take as often as I can, and I actually get to do it fairly often.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">My girlfriend on the other hand, not so much.  Her new job requires her to be up and alert in the early hours of the morning, and science is saying that**[she should be the one sleeping in, not me](http://dukemagazine.duke.edu/issues/050608/depgaz15.html)**.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“In fact, women need 20 minutes more shut-eye than the average man.” writes study authors. “And that’s down to a woman’s busy, multi-tasking brain.” </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">**[Professor Jim Horne](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1246029/Who-REALLY-needs-sleep--men-women-One-Britains-leading-sleep-experts-says-answer.html)**, director of the Sleep Research Center at Loughborough University and author of </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleepfaring: A Journey Through The Science of Sleep</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">, says:</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The more of your brain you use during the day, the more of it that needs to recover and, consequently, the more sleep you need. Women tend to multi-task — they do lots at once and are flexible — and so they use more of their actual brain than men do. Because of that, their sleep need is greater. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A man who has a complex job that involves a lot of decision-making and lateral thinking may also need more sleep than the average male — though probably still not as much as a woman.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, whether you’re shaking your head in disbelief, or nodding your head in agreement (as you’ve known for years that women’s brains are highly complex and nearly impossible to figure out) it would appear that women do, on average, need about 20 more minutes of sleep than men.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is because women’s brains are wired differently from men’s and are more complex, so their sleep need will be slightly greater. The average is 20 minutes more, but some women may need slightly more or less than this.” </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, however, another study looking at 210 middle-aged men and women discovered that **[women suffered greater health issues from lack of sleep than men did](http://dukemagazine.duke.edu/issues/050608/depgaz15.html).**</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We found that for women, poor sleep is strongly associated with high levels of psychological distress and greater feelings of hostility, depression, and anger. In contrast, these feelings were not associated with the same degree of sleep disruption in men.”</span>\n\nSo guys, if you want a happy, healthy girlfriend or wife, make sure they’re getting the sleep they need to keep those high-functioning, complex brains of theirs well rested.\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting to sleep in is one of the greatest joys in this world.  Waking up, knowing that you can start your day whenever you please is an indulgence that I take as often as I can, and I actually get to do it fairly often.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My girlfriend on the other hand, not so much.  Her new job requires her to be up and alert in the early hours of the morning, and science is saying that<strong><a href="http://dukemagazine.duke.edu/issues/050608/depgaz15.html">she should be the one sleeping in, not me</a></strong>.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In fact, women need 20 minutes more shut-eye than the average man.” writes study authors. “And that’s down to a woman’s busy, multi-tasking brain.” </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1246029/Who-REALLY-needs-sleep--men-women-One-Britains-leading-sleep-experts-says-answer.html">Professor Jim Horne</a></strong>, director of the Sleep Research Center at Loughborough University and author of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleepfaring: A Journey Through The Science of Sleep</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says:</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The more of your brain you use during the day, the more of it that needs to recover and, consequently, the more sleep you need. Women tend to multi-task — they do lots at once and are flexible — and so they use more of their actual brain than men do. Because of that, their sleep need is greater. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man who has a complex job that involves a lot of decision-making and lateral thinking may also need more sleep than the average male — though probably still not as much as a woman.”</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, whether you’re shaking your head in disbelief, or nodding your head in agreement (as you’ve known for years that women’s brains are highly complex and nearly impossible to figure out) it would appear that women do, on average, need about 20 more minutes of sleep than men.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is because women’s brains are wired differently from men’s and are more complex, so their sleep need will be slightly greater.

might be projecting.  When empaths happen across an individual who is hiding behind fake behaviors, they feel their inner pain.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">An experienced empath is highly aware of the different levels of falseness and the reasons behind it, while a less experienced empath might struggle to figure out why someone just feels naturally wrong to them.</span>\n\n**Traits and behaviors in others that leave the empath feeling terrible:**\n\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to be loved by everyone, a person acts overly nice or interested toward what people have to say</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone who is visibly angry at the world, but strives to convince everyone otherwise</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">The person who acts tough because their emotionally damaged childhood has rendered them insecure and wounded</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone who has constructed an entirely new, false identity to hide the one they fear will not be accepted by others</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone who praises you often, but is entirely insincere in doing so</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone who falsifies all of their stories to seem interesting</span>\n\n**And the ways that empaths react…:**\n\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoiding this person, even when they’ve done nothing to make you feel this way</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Completely unable to speak to this person, asking only questions and saying things that really don’t make sense</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a feeling of dread or gloom that rests in the pit of the stomach until the fake person is some distance away</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Spending more than an hour with a fake person drains you or leaves you feeling sick</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">You feel guilty because you like the person, but

like everyone says it is, sometimes life has an odd way of showing it.  I know many of us are probably wondering when the ‘ups’ are going to show up and get rid of all the downs.  Life isn’t always easy.  And no one told you it was going to be.  The only thing anyone can promise is that it will be worth it.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So remember these five things when life starts throwing shade your way:</span>\n\n**Where you are right now is exactly where you should be**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being stuck in a crappy place is no fun, so much so that we will often try to avoid the reality of our situation.  We shouldn’t be here, we don’t want to be here.  But understanding that this is but one step along your path will allow you to live in the moment, happy, present and aware.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being here now is what will get you to tomorrow.</span>\n\n**Your attitude makes all the difference**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a terrible attitude about your already terrible situation only compounds how terrible things really are.  Remember that you can always change your mindset or perspective on things, and doing so will help you radiate positivity.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want a positive life, you can’t build it with a negative attitude.</span>\n\n**Each person’s path is unique to them**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you get caught up comparing your life to those of the people around you, try to ditch this habit immediately.  Comparing yourself to anyone is pointless.  Each person’s journey through this life is entirely unique to them.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only person you should be comparing yourself to is yourself, the person you were yesterday.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to be better than that person, no one else.</span>\n\n**You must be kind to yourself**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re always our own worst critic.  Sometimes what we do is never good enough for ourselves.  But speaking hurtful words about yourself does nothing to benefit you.  Try to give yourself the same leniency that you’d give your friends and family members.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re trying, you’re doing your best, and know that it’s enough.</span>\n\n**Practicing gratitude can only benefit you**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ungrateful people will always be able to find trouble or duress in their life, regardless of how peaceful or perfect they are.  But grateful people are able to find peace during the most troubling times.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that there is always something to be grateful for, and looking for things to stay positive about during negative times shows leadership and strength.  </span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If life is a series of ups and downs like everyone says it is, sometimes life has an odd

But new research has found that intelligence might be the one thing we shouldn’t be ready to settle for, as **[brainy partners](http://www.simplemost.com/marrying-smart-woman-help-prolong-life/)**were found to extend lifespans and keep dementia at bay.</span>\n\n**[Professor Lawrence Whalley](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3529167/Marry-intelligent-woman-defeat-dementia-men-told-Experts-say-brainy-partner-acts-buffer-disease.html)**<span style="font-weight: 400;">, emeritus professor of mental health in the College of Medicine and Life Sciences at the University of Aberdeen, had this to say during a talk entitled ‘Dementia: How Can We Protect Ourselves?’</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘The thing a boy is never told he needs to do if he wants to live a longer life – but what he should do – is marry an intelligent woman.

This all stems from previous research showing that brain games, like **[crossword puzzles](http://iheartintelligence.com/2016/04/25/benefits-crossword-puzzles/)** for example, help stave off degenerative brain disease through stimulation of the brain.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it would follow that a person whose brain is engaged and stimulated by their partner regularly would gain much of the same benefit.

1410	8dec9ab5-b756-4c1d-9b14-6de753eb3117	5 Things That You Don't Need to Justify to Anyone	5-things-that-you-dont-need-to-justify-to-anyone	\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the sad truths of life is that not everyone is not always going to support your decisions.  And there will certainly be times where you find yourself at a crossroads, staring down two different paths, knowing that no one can make the choice for you but yourself.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because at the end of the day, it’s your life.  So live it how you want to live it, because the last thing you want to regret when you’ve death looming over you is that you lived a life for someone other than yourself.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five things you never need to justify to anyone else:</span>\n\n**Why you have to put yourself first**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t prioritize yourself then there’s a good chance that many others will not do so either.  Investing in yourself should never been as selfish, it’s easy for many of us get caught up in putting others’ needs before our own.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that your needs and desires are being satisfied and don’t feel the need to explain why.</span>\n\n**Wanting to express your emotions**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Expressing emotion is one of the most human things a person can do.  Our emotions are there for a reason.  Never be afraid to cry, get angry or throw a fit.  It’s always better to let it out than to keep it in.  Your emotions are real.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If others judge you for doing this, they’re the ones who need an adjustment, not you.  </span>\n\n**Your weird quirky self**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re all weird.  Some of us more weird than others, but we’re all weird and strange in some way.  It’s kind of weird to not be weird.  So celebrate your weirdness, it’s what makes you who you are, it’s what makes you different than the next person.  Never hide it away or feel ashamed by it.</span>\n\n**Making the decision to forgive**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Forgiving a person isn’t always easy, it takes strength.  Grudges are easy to hold because it’s easy to feel like you’re owed something.  Forgiving someone means that you acknowledge what’s happened, why you felt the way you did and why you’re ready to not feel that way anymore.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re accepting the past and moving forward, so that you might heal and grow.</span>\n\n**Why you’ve failed and why you’re not afraid to keep failing**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Failing in life is one of the greatest gifts, as it gives us so much knowledge.  Sure, you learn a little bit when you succeed, but not compared to how much you learn when you fail.  Never let the fear of failure keep you from acting.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn to fail, learn to get comfortable doing it often, and then learn to grow back stronger afterward.  </span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the sad truths of life is that not everyone is not always going to support your decisions.  And there will certainly be times where you find yourself at a crossroads, staring down two different paths, knowing that no one can make the choice for you but yourself.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because at the end of the day, it’s your life.  So live it how you want to live it, because the last thing you want

emotions</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expressing emotion is one of the most human things a person can do.  Our emotions are there for a reason.  Never be afraid to cry, get angry or throw a fit.  It’s always better to let it out than to keep it in.  Your emotions are real.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If others judge you for doing this, they’re the ones who need an adjustment, not you.  </span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Your weird quirky self</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re all weird.  Some of us more weird than others, but we’re all weird and strange in some way.  It’s kind of weird to not be weird.  So celebrate your weirdness, it’s what makes you who you are, it’s what makes you different than the next person.  Never hide it away or feel ashamed by it.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Making the decision to forgive</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forgiving a person isn’t always easy, it takes strength.  Grudges are easy to hold because it’s easy to feel like you’re owed something.  Forgiving someone means that you acknowledge what’s happened, why you felt the way you did and why you’re ready to not feel that way anymore.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re accepting the past and moving forward, so that you might heal and grow.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why you’ve failed and why you’re not afraid to keep failing</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failing in life is one of the greatest gifts, as it gives us so much knowledge.  Sure, you learn a little bit when you succeed, but not compared to how much you learn when you fail.  Never let the fear of failure keep you from acting.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn to fail, learn to get comfortable doing it often, and then learn to grow back stronger afterward.  </span></p>	http://cdn.heartcenteredrebalancing.com/2016/05/asd.jpg	f	f	published	en_US	public	\N	\N	1	2016-05-31

However, in the end, a dog’s motivation for doing most of this is simply so they can protect you in the best way possible (<strong><a href="http://api.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&amp;jsonp=vglnk_147071289063517&amp;key=d315a21d6d5a1bf22f62a7d4512f1e04&amp;libId=irmvnqmq0100rbdo000DA4lcf1lek&amp;loc=http%3A%2F%2Fhellogiggles.com%2Fdogs-tilt-heads%2F2%2F%23read&amp;v=1&amp;out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.the-scientist.com%2F%3Farticles.view%2FarticleNo%2F38279%2Ftitle%2FOrigin-of-Domestic-Dogs%2F&amp;ref=http%3A%2F%2Fhellogiggles.com%2Fdogs-tilt-heads%2F&amp;title=This%20is%20why%20dogs%20tilt%20their%20heads%2C%20in%20case%20you%20were%20wondering%20-%20Page%202%20of%202&amp;txt=that%E2%80%99s%20a%20fact.">they’re that loyal</a></strong>). </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, now you know!

And they come in all different forms, from the psychopath to the sociopath. They all share common traits and behaviors, which you should probably be aware of, so you can recognize a toxic person and do your best to get rid of them or avoid them at all costs.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five ways that toxic people manipulate you into complete silence:</span>\n\n**“Gaslighting”**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">**[Gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting)** is a fairly simple tactic that gets used often by toxic people. You can recognize it when people start calling out a toxic person’s poor behavior or actions, and they vehemently deny the reality of what happened, claiming the other person to be crazy or mentally unstable. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they’re doing things that drive you crazy, and then deny any wrongdoing, they’re gaslighting you.</span>\n\n**Word Salad**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever asked a person a question, but instead of an actual answer, all you get is them talking in circles trying to form a somewhat coherent argument as to why any and all responsibility should be lifted from them? They do this to confuse and irritate you. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll really notice it when you disagree with them on a minor issue, and they start personally attacking every aspect of your life.</span>\n\n**Blanket Generalizations**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The worse kinds of toxic people are terrible at forming legitimate arguments. Instead, they often use generalizations to prove points that aren’t necessarily true. Words like ‘never’ and ‘always’ get tossed around a lot in regards to behavior. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t be logical with them, otherwise they throw another fit and start with the personal attacks again.</span>\n\n**Quick to Conclusions**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Toxic people like to think that they know what others are thinking and feeling at most times. But they only operate and act in a world filled with their delusions, so they tend to immediately think they know exactly what’s going on. So, they aren’t apologetic, they try to speak for you, and should you ever resist, they’ll make </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> look like the insane one. </span>\n\n**Subject Changes**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A popular tactic among toxic people is to simply change the subject as soon as it starts focusing on them and their negative behaviors. When this happens, keep your cool and focus entirely on what you want to talk about, always bringing it back to the issue at hand instead of letting them trail off on some random tangent. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If this is a lost cause, just choose not to interact with them. There’s no point in wasting anymore energy on them.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toxic people make their way into our lives sometimes without us even realizing it.

 While it’s almost impossible to fathom what events of the world are yet to come, living well over a hundred or even two-hundred years is something that I often think about; mainly because I want to be around to see the future of mankind.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While I most likely will not live to be past 100 (150 with modern science </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">maybe</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">) years old, there is one man in history who lived to be older than 250! </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"> A 1930 New York Times article details the story of a man named Li Ching Yuen, which Imperial Chinese government documents have been found congratulating him on his 150th birthday in 1827, and then on his 200th birthday in 1877.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A New York Times correspondent noted that, in Li’s neighborhood were old men whose grandfathers knew Li when they were young boys, and that he was a grown man when they knew him.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tales of Li that are widely accepted in his province say that he was able to read and write as a child, and by ten years of age had traveled to Kansu, Shansi, Tibet, Annam, Siam and Manchuria to gather herbs.  He would gather herbs for 100 years before finally starting a small business where he sold the herbs he once gathered.</span>\n\n**He wasn’t the oldest man to have lived, though**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Li’s disciples, Li once came across a man who had lived to be 500 years old.  This man taught him Qigong exercises and the diet that would help Li to live for extended periods of time. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">But on his deathbed, Li is quoted saying, “I have done all that I have to do in this world.”  </span>\n\n**The secret to perpetual health**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Li’s only advice when asked about his secret to a long life was this: “Keep a quiet heart, sit like a tortoise, walk sprightly like a pigeon and sleep like a dog.”  These were the same words Li gave Wu Pei-Fu, the warlord who invited Li to his home, so that he might learn his ways.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Li believed that looking inward, working to create a sense of calm and peacefulness through meditation and breathing techniques were the secret to incredible health.  Essentially, it is your state of mind.</span>\n\n**Hard to believe?**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, this knowledge at face value will have most people skeptical, as we in the Western world have average lifespans of about 70-85 years.  The difference that we must keep in mind when pondering these ideas is that not everyone on this planet has devoted themselves to a 9 to 5 working world lifestyle.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They aren’t plagued with debt, they aren’t living in crowded polluted cities, and they’re using their bodies to work regularly.  Also, they aren’t consuming refined sugars or flours, fatty meats, genetically modified foods, or the typical junk foods we like to binge on every now and then.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention, they spend almost all of their time in nature, perfecting their breathing techniques and meditating, practices that have been shown to boost mental, physical and emotional wellbeing.  And finally, they get proper sleep and spend time in the sun, something that we all typically refer to as “vacation” nowadays.</span>\n\nTreating our bodies right is the first step to living a long, happy and healthy life.  We just have to be disciplined and determined.  How long do you want to live?\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever wondered what it might be like to live for hundreds of years?

Remove all of the pulp from its surface. A good way to do this is to simply suck on it until it is clean.</span>\n4. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not delay to plant. The seed must still be moist when it is buried into the soil. Plant the seed about half an inch deep in the middle of the pot.</span>\n5. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Spray the soil that is directly above the seed gently with water from a spray bottle.</span>\n6. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cover the pot with clear plastic wrap, seal the edges with a good rubber band, and poke small holes in the top with a pencil.</span>\n7. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Place the pot in a warm, sunny location.</span>\n8. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Spray on more water occasionally, not allowing the soil to dry out. Do not cause water to puddle though. Just keep the soil somewhat moist.</span>\n9. <span style="font-weight: 400;">After about two weeks, when the sproutling emerges, take the plastic covering off. If you need additional light for your lemon plant, you can use a grow light to supplement the sun’s light.</span>\n10. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Take care of the young plant by keeping the soil damp, by making sure it gets at least eight full hours of light per day, and by giving it moderate doses of organic fertilizer.</span>\n11. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch over your plant to ensure it is not attacked by bugs or diseases. Prune off brown, dead leaves when necessary. Use pesticides if you must. Protect your new lemon tree!</span>\n12. <span style="font-weight: 400;">When the plant outgrows its small pot, put it in the larger pot. You will go through much the same procedure when you re-plant it as when you first planted. Younger plants need more water than older plants, but they all do need adequate water. Don’t starve your poor plant after all that work of growing it!</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/57XoFG0QuMI?feature=oembed" width="1170"></iframe>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is it cheaper to grow your own lemons, but you gain real experience growing plant life, making it valuable as well as educational.  Not to mention, you pretty much have fresh lemons whenever you want them and the lemon tree is a stylish piece of home decor.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, take on a new summer project and see if you can grow your own lemon tree.  And be sure to share this fun idea with someone who loves fresh lemons and growing fruit!</span>\n\nh/t [**EcoSnippet**](http://www.ecosnippets.com/gardening/grow-lemons-from-seed/)\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You always hear the phrase ‘when life gives you lemons..’ being said when times are tough.  But it takes on a whole new meaning after you learn how to grow your own lemon tree, because now when life gives you lemons, you simply plant and grow more lemons!</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing your own lemon tree is easy and highly rewarding, making it a fun little side project if you’re looking for something to do or simply want a steady supply of lemons.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemon trees grow their very hardest when they’re outdoors, year-round, in a hot and sunny climate.  However, they can be grown inside during seasons with cold or not ideal climates.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>To start growing your lemon tree – Procure the following items</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">An organic lemon since non-organic lemons often contain non-germinating seeds</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fertile potting soil, preferably containing peat, vermiculite, perlite, and natural fertilizers</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A planting pot that is six inches wide and six inches deep (will be used for sprouting)</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A seedling pot that is about 24 inches wide by 12 inches deep</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sunny, indoor growing location and possibly a grow light</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Use these steps to grow your lemon tree</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moisten the potting soil so that it is damp, but not soaked, all the way through.</span>  </li>\n<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fill the smaller pot with soil, all the way up to an inch below the rim.</span>  </li>\n<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cut open your lemon and remove a seed.

And talk and talk.  And they interests are so diverse that they struggle to focus on any one thing.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like the crab, Cancer are incredibly moody people.  They don’t enjoy going out of their comfort zone and can be incredibly sensitive at times.  Chin up, Cancer, it’s not that bad.</span>\n\n**Leo**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A lesson in vanity and ego.  The Leo thinks they are the most beautiful in all the land, and they’ve got the charm to go with it.  Careful when you’re around them; they’ll smooth talk you into doing things you’ve never even thought of before.  Also, they think they’re the center of the universe.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virgo is the highly judgmental and pessimistic perfectionist.  Their keen sense for attention to detail keeps them busy in a world full of imperfection.  And they can be drama queens when things aren’t going their way.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t hold your breath for the Libra–they like to take their sweet time weighing each and every option before committing to anything.  They’re fascinated with pretty things, which is why they spend so much time getting ready before doing anything.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Scorpio can hold a grudge like no one’s business.  They will make you regret ever wronging them.  They’re master manipulators, pulling strings here and there to get what they want.  And, they enjoy brooding over the sorrowful things in life.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being honest is good to a point, but the Sagittarians often take it too far.  They don’t like to sugarcoat things, meaning they’re blunt and straight to the point, even when they shouldn’t be.  They like to think they know everything and they crave excitement, growing bored quickly with old things.</span>\n\n**Capricorn**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Capricorn gets lost in their obsession with control.  Living life in the moment is not possible for them.  They can be manipulative in using others for their own needs and they feed off of negative energy.</span>\n\n**Aquarius**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Aquarius likes to think that they stand from a point of objectiveness and logic, they’re often some of the most judgmental people.  As such, they’re quick to give (what they think is) objective and logical advice, even if they don’t fully understand the situation.</span>\n\n**Pisces**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Opposite the Capricorn, the Pisces has so much “live in the moment” attitude that their lives often lack direction.  Sometimes they can be space cadets, failing to notice the happenings that surround them.  This often leaves them gullible, even if they’re supposedly the oldest and wisest of all the signs.</span>\n\nh/t [**Mind Journal**](http://themindsjournal.com/dark-side/)\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You often read about all of the different positive characteristics that are associated with your Zodiac sign, but there is a less often mentioned dark side as well.  Read below to find out what yours is:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Aries</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You guys are the most impulsive and impatient sign in the Zodiac.  If things aren’t happening quickly, you’re over it.  You can also be very immature, as the youngest sign, and if an idea isn’t yours, you don’t really care about it.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Taurus</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taurus’ dark side comes in the form of materialism, stubbornness, and laziness.  They don’t like to share, are impossible to argue with and can be self-indulgent.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gemini</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gemini are the folks with an intense love for life–so much so that it can be a bad thing sometimes.  They have multiple different personalities, meaning they are enigmatic at times.  They love to talk.

and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](http://www.niddk.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx)** reports that more than two in three adults are considered to be overweight or obese, more than one in three adults are

risk for major health problems](http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/overweight-obesity-statistics.aspx)**, and we’ve all but identified the major culprits.  The main one is sugar.  Consumption of high-sugar content drinks and beverages is a major contributor to the obesity epidemic.  Your average 20-ounce soda has anywhere from **[15 to 18 teaspoons of sugar in it, and around 240 calories](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/sugary-drinks-fact-sheet/)**.  It’s basically liquid candy, except you don’t feel as “full” after drinking it.\n\n**Here are four things that happen to your body when you quit sugar:**\n\n**You gain energy – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">The more sugar you consume, the more inhibited your body’s ability to sustain energy at maximum levels becomes.  When this happens, our blood sugar levels become imbalanced.  Compared to a person who consumes sugar regularly, those who do not consume sugar benefit from improved ability to generate and store energy.  These people tend to eat foods that are high in energy content, but low in sugar content.</span>\n\n**Your weight stabilizes – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re consuming sugar on a regular basis, you’re going to gain weight and there’s no getting around it.  Especially in grown adults, sugar has been seen as directly correlated with extreme weight gain and increased risk of chronic illness.  You often hear of “beer bellies” because, well, they’re actually a thing.  Beer contains a high amount of sugar, which causes fat to build up around our tummy area.  When we quit sugar, our bodies equalize and find a natural balance.</span>\n\n**You reduce your risk for chronic illness – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">**[Diabetes is one of the most common chronic illnesses](http://www.diabetes.org/)** that is associated with obesity and unhealthy weight.  It’s main contributor is, unsurprisingly, sugar.  What’s even worse is that Diabetes can serve as a form of gateway illness, opening up the floodgates for other chronic illnesses that are at their strongest when the immune system is weak.  Quitting sugar entirely gives one the opportunity to live a chronic-illness-free life.</span>\n\n**You’ll start disliking sugar – **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugar is just like any other chemical in that when you abuse it, your body becomes addicted to it.  Alcohol, tobacco, methamphetamines, uppers, downers, you name it, if you consume them in large quantities and often, your body will crave it.  While just the opposite is true as well: if you stop consuming something altogether, your craving for that substance disappears.  So, do yourself a favor and quit sugar today, or at least limit your intake.</span>\n\nh/t[** Top

things!</span>\n\n**You care a lot**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pisces girl tends to be sort of ‘all or nothing,’ meaning that she either feels very deeply about things or doesn’t care at all.  As far as grey areas are concerned, the Pisces girl typically doesn’t deal in them.</span>\n\n**You’re also practical and down to Earth**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While you tend to feel things intensely, you never let it cloud your judgment or get the best of you.  Your pragmatism and practicality balance out your extreme emotions and feelings.</span>\n\n**You dislike hurting other people’s feelings**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of how much you genuinely care for others, it can be hard at times to turn people down or say no to people’s requests of you.  You’re always considerate of another person’s feelings.</span>\n\n**You’re often the one people assume has her life together**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of what’s going on with you emotionally, you always keep it together on the outside.  A calm, composed and happy demeanor leads many to believe that you rarely ever struggle with life’s problems.</span>\n\n**Hanging out and relaxing at home is just as good as going out**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A night out is always a good time, sure, but it will never compare to pajamas and movies with good food and good company.  The Pisces girl’s favorite activity is a night in with her best friends.</span>\n\n**You’re chock-full of good ideas**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming up with fun and creative solutions to problems is your forte as a Pisces girl.  People love hanging out with you because there’s rarely a dull moment.</span>\n\n**You’re able to forgive and forget without even trying**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Holding grudges has never been your style, and you probably couldn’t do it even if you tried.  Forgiving and moving forward is your preferred plan of

cannot control our emotions as well as we would like to.  We’re the ones who cry when we see other people cry, simply because they’re sad and we think it’s sad that they’re sad and we don’t want them to be sad.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly sensitive people are often referred to as empaths.  Those who are more sensitive than your average person, those who feel </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">.  And science shows that about 15 to 20 percent of people have a gene that makes them more sensitive than others.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If this sounds kind of like you, here are more signs that you’re a highly sensitive person:</span>\n\n**Other people’s moods affect you more than they probably should**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The highly sensitive person is incredibly attuned to the various different emotions, meaning they can easily sense them in others.  If you can tell exactly what kind of mood a person is in without them having to say a word, you’re likely an empath.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Empaths literally </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">feel</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> other people’s emotions, which can be harmful if you don’t know how to shield yourself from negative emotions.</span>\n\n**Your observation skills are finely tuned**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A highly sensitive person is also highly aware of the things that are happening around them.  Subtle things like tone of voice, slight facial expressions or cues, and tiny gestures provide you with a wealth of information about the setting you currently find yourself in.</span>\n\n**You need your alone time**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly sensitive people are constantly needing to shield and protect themselves from the various different energies and emotions surrounding them at any given time, which is exhausting. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">After social gatherings or extended periods of time without being alone, they’re likely to need a bit of downtime to recuperate and recharge.</span>\n\n**You have an uncanny ability to anticipate the things that others need**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For whatever reason, you simply know what a person needs in order for them to feel comfortable and at ease.  It most likely stems from your ability to recognize emotions and feelings, as well as the importance you place on the comfort and care of others.</span>\n\n**Everything has a certain ‘feeling’ attached to it**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything, from smells and colors to people, places, and even certain times, all have a specific ‘feeling’ to them.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are those of us who simply cannot control our emotions as well as we would like to.  We’re the ones who cry when we see other people cry,

recharge.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>You have an uncanny ability to anticipate the things that others need</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For whatever reason, you simply know what a person needs in order for them to feel comfortable and at ease.  It most likely stems from your ability to recognize emotions and feelings, as well as the importance you place on the comfort and care of others.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Everything has a certain ‘feeling’ attached to it</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything, from smells and colors to people, places, and even

all you need to do is figure out the lesson behind all of it.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are 10 types of body pain and their related emotional states:</span>\n\n**Muscle pains**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are often a result of getting ‘stuck’ on different aspects of our lives.  Whether it be at work, at home, or battles within, learning to ebb and flow with the ever changing currents of your life will ease these pains.</span>\n\n**Pain in the head**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Headaches are associated with the inability to make a decision.  And migraines, being the older brother of headaches, occur when you know what decision you need to make do not make it.  To ease these pains, remember to make time for yourself to relax and unwind each day.</span>\n\n**Neck pains**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain in the neck is linked to forgiveness, whether it be forgiving others or yourself.  Reflect on the things you love about yourself as well as the things you love about those around you; this will help you become more aware and more capable of letting go.</span>\n\n**Gum pain**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to neck pain, gum pain is tied to inaction regarding decision-making.  Be assertive, be confident and make choices with purpose.</span>\n\n**Stomach pain**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain in our stomachs are related to a lack of feeling whole or fulfilled in life.  It is the result of a void within ourselves, one that leaves us in pain.</span>\n\n**Lower back pain**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress caused by anxiety over finances or even just a general lack of emotional support can cause pain in the lower back.  This could be a sign that it’s time you ask for a raise or work to manage your money more efficiently.</span>\n\n**Pain in the elbows**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Elbow pain is correlated with resistance to any change that may be happening in your life.  Stiffness is indicative of stiffness in your life.  You may want to consider rocking the boat a little bit; stir things up and see what happens.  All you can really do anyway is let the flow take you; be like water.</span>\n\n**Pain in the arms**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Arm pain means that you’re carrying a burden, whether it be your own or that of another person’s.  Take time to reflect on this burden and decide whether or not you need to keep carrying it.</span>\n\n**Hand pain**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand pain is associated with how often you’re reaching out to others.  If you’re experiencing hand pain, attempt to make new friends or reconnect with an old one.  Make plans with your coworkers or neighbors.  Build new connections.</span>\n\n**Pain in the teeth**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Teeth pains are connected to consistent negative thought patterns, ones that repeat how much you dislike your current situation.  If you practice positive thought patterns, ones that focus on how your experiences flow through you with ease, you can relieve this pain.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">h/t [**Prevent Disease**](http://preventdisease.com/news/15/060815_20-Sources-Pain-Tied-To-Specific-Emotional-States.shtml)</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding what pain is will help you tremendously on your journey through life.  First and foremost, pain is energy.  Secondly, it is perception.  And lastly, pain is the physical manifestation that you feel.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practically every bit of pain we’ve ever felt in our body is linked to various different emotional states.  These emotional states serve as warnings, indicating that we still have areas that need to be healed and subsequently grown from.  Learning our lessons and growing is the only way to rid ourselves of the pain.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain in the body is quite literal.  Certain experiences trigger certain pains, telling you what the problem is;

widely considered to be one of the most influential chakras we have, as it is the one that connects us to the physical realm.  When the root chakra becomes imbalanced, the other chakras suffer as well. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting at the base of our spines, the root chakra is connected to our hips, thighs, knees and feet.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re unsure as to whether or not your root chakra is healthy and balanced, see if you suffer from any of the symptoms below:</span>\n\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have an eating disorder, trouble with constipation, or issues with the knees, feet or prostate gland</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re struggling from financial hardship</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Any family issues that might be holding you or the family back</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Feelings of anger or greed</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Any co-dependence you have on another person</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Feelings of depression or fear</span>\n- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Extreme laziness</span>\n\n**And the 7 great ways to rebalance and strengthen the Root Chakra**\n\n1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Use oils that are known for their ability to improve the root chakra’s health.  Oils like cedar wood, myrrh, and patchouli.  A few drops on the bottoms of your feet will work great.</span>\n2. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Practicing reflexology and aromatherapy.  Attention paid specifically to the feet helps the root chakra to move.</span>\n3. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Spend as much time outside as possible.  Being barefoot helps build our bond with the Earth.</span>\n4. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Set gemstones, like bloodstone, red jasper and black tourmaline on the center of your root chakra.</span>\n5. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Consuming root foods helps to promote a healthy root chakra.  These are foods like potatoes, carrots, radishes, onions, garlic and beets.</span>\n6. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound therapy has also been seen to aid in balancing and clearing the root chakra.  </span>\n7. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, using positive phrases and affirmations will fortify your root chakra.  Try saying things like:</span>1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">I am deeply connected to my body.</span>\n2. <span style="font-weight: 400;">I am grounded, stable and all is safe in my world.</span>\n3. <span style="font-weight:

love with someone then you know that love is not the type of emotion that can be adequately conveyed with three simple words.  Love is more than lusting after physical attraction, it’s more than anything we could ever imagine.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s about loving someone for who they are, flaws and all.  It’s about being a pillar of strength during tough times.  It’s about showing how much you care in little ways.  And one of the easiest ways to express love for your person is by using your words.  Words that mean more than a simple ‘I love you.’</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five phrases that express love better than the three words we’re all used to saying so often:</span>\n\n**‘I’m lucky to be yours’**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’ve fallen for someone pretty hard, feeling lucky comes easy.  It happens in those moments when you’re least expecting it, when you’re suddenly overcome with an intense realization that you want this to last forever.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you start to feel that you are unworthy of this person’s love, time, and attention, don’t forget to tell them how grateful you are to have them in your life.</span>\n\n**‘I’m sorry’**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing when you’re wrong and when to apologize for your actions, words, or behaviors, is much more important than throwing out a simple ‘I love you.’  If you get caught up in a fight or make a huge mistake and know you were in the wrong, own up to it.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need to waste your time trying to prove a point if you truly care about them.  Ask for forgiveness and move forward.</span>\n\n**‘I forgive you’**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same way that you should apologize, also be willing to forgive.  When you know that your partner is truly sorry, and their transgressions are forgivable, don’t hesitate to forgive them.  Holding grudges and staying upset is wasted energy, energy that could be spent on building and nurturing your relationship.</span>\n\n**‘I support you’**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouraging, motivating, and generally supporting your partner is something that they can’t get from anyone else.  It means the world when your partner has your back during times of uncertainty or change.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Never be afraid to reassure them that they’re more than capable of achieving their goals and that you’ll be by their side every step of the way.</span>\n\n**‘I’m committed to you, to us’**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing that your partner is entirely faithful and committed to the love you two share is an amazing feeling.  Never hesitate to tell them that your heart is theirs or how often you think about them.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The open expression of commitment illustrates your love and sincerity for this feeling toward them.  When you’re feeling the love, tell them!</span>\n\nh/t [**ReRules**](http://www.relrules.com/9-phrases-more-important-than-i-love-you/5/)\n\n\n	\N	<p><span

The concept is not entirely new, however, as numerous other animals have been found to use magnetoreception; primarily as a means to navigate long distances using only the Earth’s magnetic field as a guide.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the list of animals that use magnetoreception are sea turtles, honey bees, dolphins, and lobsters. Each of these creatures possesses an inherent magnetic compass that aids in their navigation of the world around them. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, that is pretty much all we know about the phenomena. How this internal magnetic compass gets used, how it senses magnetic fields, and what information is gathered by doing so, are all areas of speculation at this point.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Kirschvink, a geophysicist at the California Institute of Technology who is [currently studying humans and their magnetic sense](http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/its-part-of-our-evolutionary-history-american-scientist-thinks-hes-found-a-sixth-sense-in-humans), says, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it’s part of our evolutionary history. Magnetoreception may be the primal sense.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirschvink’s study, which can be found in </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Communications</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">, posits that there is a specific protein found in the human retina that can detect magnetic fields when inserted into fruit flies. The research shows that this protein clearly serves as a magneto sensor, but there is no certainty that humans actually use it for such a purpose.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It poses the question, ‘maybe we should rethink about this </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">sixth sense</span>](http://www.livescience.com/5083-cows-strange-sixth-sense.html)<span style="font-weight: 400;">,’” University of Massachusetts Medical School researcher Steven Reppert told </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">LiveScience</span>](http://www.livescience.com/14694-humans-sixth-sense-magnetic-fields.html)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is thought to be very important for how animals migrate. Perhaps this protein is also fulfilling an important function for sensing magnetic fields in humans.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If we look at past [scientific literature](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3833489/) surrounding this area of study, [we can see](https://www.crcpress.com/Bioelectromagnetic-and-Subtle-Energy-Medicine-Second-Edition/Rosch/p/book/9781482233193) that numerous studies have found a distinct connection between the collective behaviors of people on a global scale and solar and geomagnetic activity. It’s even been seen that disturbances of these fields can be responsible for detrimental health effects and behaviors of humans.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[This data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9783072) suggests that, [somehow](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8199794), major parts of the human body, like the brain, cardiovascular system and nervous system, [resonate with geomagnetic frequencies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5784247_Solar_activity_revolutions_and_cultural_prime_in_the_history_of_mankind). For example, if the Earth’s magnetic field is somehow disrupted on a major level, it leads to health problems in humans, such as trouble sleeping, emotional confusion, feeling more tired than usual, or feeling overwhelmed for no reason at all.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s cool is that there’s also been evidence that we are not only influenced by these magnetic fields, but are capable of influencing the fields ourselves. It’s a two-way street. Just as we accept information, we can also upload it, in a sense. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">One great example of this is [the human heart](https://www.amazon.ca/Heart-Intelligence-Connecting-Intuitive-Guidance/dp/1943625433). The human heart has its own electromagnetic field, and it fluctuates according to the different emotions we’re feeling at the time. These fluctuations have been measured and found to exist up to several feet outside the human body itself. </span>\n\n*<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Human emotions and consciousness interact with and encode information into the geomagnetic field and this information is distributed globally. . . . We are suggesting in essence that this encoded information is communicated nonlocally between people at a subconscious level, in effect linking all living systems.

The concept is not entirely new, however, as numerous other animals have been found to use magnetoreception; primarily as a means to navigate long distances using only the Earth’s magnetic field as a guide.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the list of animals that use magnetoreception are sea turtles, honey bees, dolphins, and lobsters. Each of these creatures possesses an inherent magnetic compass that aids in their navigation of the world around them. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, that is pretty much all we know about the phenomena. How this internal magnetic compass gets used, how it senses magnetic fields, and what information is gathered by doing so, are all areas of speculation at this point.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Kirschvink, a geophysicist at the California Institute of Technology who is <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/its-part-of-our-evolutionary-history-american-scientist-thinks-hes-found-a-sixth-sense-in-humans">currently studying humans and their magnetic sense</a>, says, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it’s part of our evolutionary history. Magnetoreception may be the primal sense.”</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirschvink’s study, which can be found in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Communications</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, posits that there is a specific protein found in the human retina that can detect magnetic fields when inserted into fruit flies. The research shows that this protein clearly serves as a magneto sensor, but there is no certainty that humans actually use it for such a purpose.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It poses the question, ‘maybe we should rethink about this </span><a href="http://www.livescience.com/5083-cows-strange-sixth-sense.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sixth sense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,’” University of Massachusetts Medical School researcher Steven Reppert told </span><a href="http://www.livescience.com/14694-humans-sixth-sense-magnetic-fields.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LiveScience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is thought to be very important for how animals migrate. Perhaps this protein is also fulfilling an important function for sensing magnetic fields in humans.”</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we look at past <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3833489/">scientific literature</a> surrounding this area of study, <a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Bioelectromagnetic-and-Subtle-Energy-Medicine-Second-Edition/Rosch/p/book/9781482233193">we can see</a> that numerous studies have found a distinct connection between the collective behaviors of people on a global scale and solar and geomagnetic activity. It’s even been seen that disturbances of these fields can be responsible for detrimental health effects and behaviors of humans.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9783072">This data</a> suggests that, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8199794">somehow</a>, major parts of the human body, like the brain, cardiovascular system and nervous system, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5784247_Solar_activity_revolutions_and_cultural_prime_in_the_history_of_mankind">resonate with geomagnetic frequencies</a>. For example, if the Earth’s magnetic field is somehow disrupted on a major level, it leads to health problems in humans, such as trouble sleeping, emotional confusion, feeling more tired than usual, or feeling overwhelmed for no reason at all.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s cool is that there’s also been evidence that we are not only influenced by these magnetic fields, but are capable of influencing the fields ourselves. It’s a two-way street. Just as we accept information, we can also upload it, in a sense. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One great example of this is <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Heart-Intelligence-Connecting-Intuitive-Guidance/dp/1943625433">the human heart</a>. The human heart has its own electromagnetic field, and it fluctuates according to the different emotions we’re feeling at the time. These fluctuations have been measured and found to exist up to several feet outside the human body itself. </span></p>\n\n<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Human emotions and consciousness interact with and encode information into the geomagnetic field and this information is distributed globally. . . . We are suggesting in essence that this encoded information is communicated nonlocally between people at a subconscious level, in effect linking all living systems. Magnetic fields act as carrier waves for this information, which can influence all living systems – positively or negatively – within the field environment as well as our collective consciousness.”</span></em></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While research into this field is still in its earliest stages, the implications of what they’ve found are huge.

And that they are everywhere. And there’s no need to protect them,” Fennessy told The Dodo.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This perception is slowly starting to become realized as false, and now time is no longer on their side.  One sort of ‘silver lining’ to these animals being researched, however, is that scientists are continuing to learn more about the giraffe’s capacity for emotion, and are weeding out old myths in the process.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoe Muller, founder of the </span>**[Rothschild’s Giraffe Project](http://www.girafferesearch.com/)**<span style="font-weight: 400;">, says, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask any safari guide in Africa about their behavior and they will delight in telling you how female giraffe are bad mothers, apparently abandoning their young hours after giving birth and leaving them alone and vulnerable in the African bush.” </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A notion that Muller has found to be untrue.  One giraffe that she followed during her research gave birth to a calf in the spring of 2010.  At around one month of age and suffering from a deformed leg, the calf struggled to walk and rarely moved because of it.  But the mother giraffe never left its side.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“[S]he could always be found next to her calf, standing with it and being vigilant to the surrounding area,” Muller wrote.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the baby calf passed away one morning, most likely due to natural causes.  But, shortly after, Muller discovered 17 other female giraffes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“all highly vigilant and running around in apparently bizarre patterns.”</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8bI20ZglxOI?feature=oembed" width="1170"></iframe>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While Muller is reluctant to categorize their behavior as “mourning,” she acknowledges that it is similar to another mammal that is notorious for their grieving of lost loved ones: elephants.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is well documented that elephants show great interest in the carcasses and bones of other dead elephants and herd members, often viewed as evidence of their empathic nature and ability to ‘mourn’ their dead,” she says.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“…</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we are only just beginning to understand the complexities of their social systems and family networks.

And there’s no need to protect them,” Fennessy told The Dodo.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This perception is slowly starting to become realized as false, and now time is no longer on their side.  One sort of ‘silver lining’ to these animals being researched, however, is that scientists are continuing to learn more about the giraffe’s capacity for emotion, and are weeding out old myths in the process.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoe Muller, founder of the </span><strong><a href="http://www.girafferesearch.com/">Rothschild’s Giraffe Project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask any safari guide in Africa about their behavior and they will delight in telling you how female giraffe are bad mothers, apparently abandoning their young hours after giving birth and leaving them alone and vulnerable in the African bush.” </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A notion that Muller has found to be untrue.  One giraffe that she followed during her research gave birth to a calf in the spring of 2010.  At around one month of age and suffering from a deformed leg, the calf struggled to walk and rarely moved because of it.  But the mother giraffe never left its side.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[S]he could always be found next to her calf, standing with it and being vigilant to the surrounding area,” Muller wrote.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the baby calf passed away one morning, most likely due to natural causes.  But, shortly after, Muller discovered 17 other female giraffes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“all highly vigilant and running around in apparently bizarre patterns.”</span></p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8bI20ZglxOI?feature=oembed" width="1170"></iframe>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Muller is reluctant to categorize their behavior as “mourning,” she acknowledges that it is similar to another mammal that is notorious for their grieving of lost loved ones: elephants.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is well documented that elephants show great interest in the carcasses and bones of other dead elephants and herd members, often viewed as evidence of their empathic nature and ability to ‘mourn’ their dead,” she says.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we are only just beginning to understand the complexities of their social systems and family networks. This incident provides us a unique insight into one aspect of giraffe behavior that we are rarely afforded a glance of — that of family ties and effects of the loss of a herd member.”</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch a video of the incident <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bI20ZglxOI">here</a></strong>, and below is video of a mother giraffe who took on a pride of lions after they took her calf, showcasing the female giraffe’s willingness to endure danger for the sake of their young.</span></p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="878" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMU_F3arSA?feature=oembed" width="1170"></iframe>\n\n<p>h/t <a href="https://www.thedodo.com/giraffe-mothers-conservation-1170369798.html"><strong>The Dodo</strong></a></p>	http://cdn.heartcenteredrebalancing.com/2016/07/feature_ima555555ge_656565template.jpg	f	f	published	en_US	public	\N	\N	1	2016-07-10 07:50:26+00	1	2016-07-10 07:50:26+00	1	2016-07-10 07:50:26+00	1

1461	509707fb-4aea-4889-82ea-70f8db1eb114	6 Helpful Tips for the Empath and Highly Sensitive People	6-helpful-tips-for-the-empath-and-highly-sensitive-people	\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">An empath is a person who has heightened senses, often feeling and experiencing the world around them much more intensely than your average person.  They pick up on the energies and auras of others, often capable of feeling their thoughts and emotions.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, many empaths aren’t even aware that they are empaths at all.  They might recognize their ability to feel others’ energies, but aren’t sure how it works.  Because regularly perceiving and mirroring other people’s energies correctly is difficult.  And there can be negative side effects for empaths who do not know how to control their gift properly.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are six tips for the empath and the highly sensitive that will help prevent becoming overwhelmed:</span>\n\n**Always make time for you**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While some people are quite afraid of being alone, spending time with yourself is necessary to create the space one needs to let go of their emotion, energy and stresses.</span>\n\n**Speak positively, think positively**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using positive affirmations to build positive thought patterns is a great practice for the empath.  Phrases like “Let me receive what is in my best and highest good at this time,” will help manifest positivity.</span>\n\n**Learning to shield**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to prevent yourself from being overwhelmed is by creating a protective shield of white light around you.  Tie it down with a grounding cord and you’re prepared to deflect any unwanted energies.</span>\n\n**Center yourself**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you leave behind the ego in order to become more in line with your spirit, you’re more capable of living in the moment, feeling free to express and release each emotion as it arises.</span>\n\n**Being in nature**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Spending time in nature and with animals is the perfect way to clear unwanted energies and connect with the world around you.</span>\n\n**Gratitude and Intentions**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people like to keep a journal to write down all of the things they are grateful for, which promotes a clean, healthy energy.  To keep this energy flowing, they also write down positive intentions to do so.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An empath is a person who has heightened senses, often feeling and experiencing the world around them much more intensely than your average person.  They pick up on the energies and auras of others, often capable of feeling their thoughts and emotions.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, many empaths aren’t even aware that they are empaths at all.  They might recognize their ability to feel others’ energies, but aren’t sure how it works.  Because regularly perceiving and mirroring other people’s energies correctly is difficult.  And there can be negative side effects for empaths who do not know how to control their gift properly.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are six tips for the empath and the highly sensitive that will help prevent becoming overwhelmed:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Always make time for you</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some people are quite afraid of being alone, spending time with yourself is necessary to create the space one needs to let go of their emotion, energy and stresses.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Speak positively, think positively</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using positive affirmations to build positive thought patterns is a great practice for the empath.  Phrases like “Let me receive what is in my best and highest good at this time,” will help manifest positivity.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Learning to shield</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to prevent yourself from being overwhelmed is by creating a protective shield of white light around you.  Tie it down with a grounding cord and you’re prepared to deflect any unwanted energies.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Center yourself</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you leave behind the ego in order to become more in line with your spirit, you’re more capable of living in the moment, feeling free to express and release each emotion as it arises.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Being in nature</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spending time in nature and with animals is the perfect way to clear unwanted energies and connect with the world around you.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gratitude and Intentions</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people like to keep a journal to write down all of the things they are grateful for, which promotes a clean, healthy energy.  To keep this energy flowing, they also write down positive intentions to do so.</span></p>	http://cdn.heartcenteredrebalancing.com/2016/07/feature_imasssge_temasdfasdplate.jpg	f	f	published	en_US	public	\N	\N	1	2016-07-12

While we sleep we disconnect our consciousness from the physical world and instead we connect more deeply with our higher self. This connection helps us create with greater ease.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">There’s a reason why people tell you to “sleep on it” when you have a big decision-in our dream state we gain clarity and understanding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are awesome creators from our sleeping state!</span>\n\n<span class="s1">In addition to helping us solve our problems and deliberately create, sleep makes us feel good, boosts our immunity, and helps us heal from injury and illness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, whenever it’s possible, it’s a good idea to take advantage of sleep.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Here are 20 things you can do at bedtime to raise your vibration and become a better deliberate creator.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Enjoy!</span>\n\n\n## <span class="s1">Bedtime DOs:</span>\n\n1. <span class="s1">Do give big hugs to the people you love before bedtime, if you live with them 🙂</span>\n2. <span class="s1">After a rough day, do take a shower or bath before bedtime to wash off the stress and elevate your vibration before drifting off.</span>\n3. <span class="s1">Do get some water to put on your nightstand. Sometimes at night we get thirsty, and we always feel better when we’re hydrated.</span>\n4. <span class="s1">Do take a moment to snuggle into bed, and appreciate how comfortable your bedding and pajamas are.</span>\n5. <span class="s1">Do spend a few moments appreciating what went well during the day.</span>\n6. <span class="s1">Do ask a question of the universe before bed. We get lots of clarity from the dream state. You could ask something like “what should I do about that problem at work?” or “what kind of present would my best friend love for her birthday?”</span>\n7. <span class="s1">Do set your intention to enjoy the next day.</span>\n8. <span class="s1">Do create a peaceful atmosphere in your bedroom. Peaceful places inspire peaceful feelings.</span>\n9. <span class="s1">If you like to watch television before bedtime, do be mindful of the programming you select. When we sleep, we often dwell on our last thoughts of the day, so be sure to select programming that’s light and* makes you feel good.*</span>\n10. <span class="s1">Do close the blinds or invest in heavy curtains if you want to sleep in the next day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The light of day is hard to ignore when it’s shining on your face!</span>\n11. <span class="s1">If you’ve got a few dollars to go shopping, do invest quality bedding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s easier to enjoy your sleep when you are comfortable! Being well-rested will help you manifest greater abundance, so comfy bedding *is worth every penny*.</span>\n12. <span class="s1">Do select a soothing alarm for the morning. Awaken to pleasing music or ringtones to gently transition into the daytime.</span>\n13. <span class="s1">Do choose to forgive and forget before going to bed. A fight that isn’t resolved at night will just pick right back up in the morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why tarnish your tomorrow over something that happened today?</span>\n14. <span class="s1">Do invest in an eye mask and earplugs if you are a light sleeper or if your partner snores.</span>\n15. <span class="s1">Do try out a sleep mediation or sleep hypnosis, especially if you could use a boost!</span>\n16. <span class="s1">Do avoid social media before bedtime.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are a lot of things running through your newsfeed, some of which may have the potential to rattle your cage while you are wanting to relax.</span>\n17. <span class="s1">Do take it easy if you find yourself wide awake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead of* trying* to fall asleep, go along with the wakefulness without struggling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can tell yourself “I’m just going to relax and take this opportunity to fantasize about pleasant things” and “when my body needs sleep it will shut me down.” The less you struggle, the easier it is to unwind. After all, if you’re going to be awake, you might as well be awake and happy!</span>\n18. <span class="s1">Do choose to review your “to do list” in the morning instead of at night. You can’t get tomorrow’s work done today.</span>\n19. <span class="s1">Do choose to go to sleep at a reasonable time (whatever that means for you of course!). Sometimes there are reasons we have to stay up extra late, but when you have the opportunity to enjoy a good night’s rest, take advantage of it!</span>\n20. <span class="s1">If you’re a lucid dreamer, do set your intention to have a lucid dream.

social settings is something that most people desire, not only for themselves, but for others.  Introverts of the world often find themselves on the outside looking in, simply because they’re different than most extroverted people.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are a few things that they want others to know about them, so that relationships and certain situations aren’t turned into bigger deals than they actually are.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are six things you should know about the introvert:</span>\n\n**We’re not too concerned about your birthday**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Introverts who work in your average office especially know what it’s like to not care about the happenings of birthdays.  We’re not interested in shelling out money for a birthday cake and we’re not about to show a sudden enthusiasm for your special day.  If you invite us out for drinks with 30 other people, chances are we’ll say no.  Or you cannot invite us at all, we’re fine with either, we just want to go home.</span>\n\n**We’re not super interested in what you did this weekend**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As introverts, we carefully pick and choose the people we spend our time with.  Random acquaintances and coworkers don’t often fit the bill.  We won’t judge you for how you spend your time and think that everyone needs a bit of privacy, but we can’t spend energy on you either.</span>\n\n**Crowds are not for us**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being around a large number of people can be incredibly overwhelming, simply because there are so many different people, all unique in their own way.  And if an introvert is also somewhat empathic, they’re prone to absorbing the energies of others.  This makes crowded spaces too stimulating and chaotic for us.</span>\n\n**We can be extroverted when we want to**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being social is not </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> alien to us.  We can be the charismatic and lively partygoer, and we can host social events.  But know that often times the thing getting us through these events is knowing that we’ll be able to go home afterward.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">After experiences like these, we like to take a few days or weeks to recharge.</span>\n\n**Rude, shy and uptight do not describe us**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people get angry with introverts or feel that they cannot talk to them.  It might seem this way initially, but once you get to know us, you’ll find that we make good friends who are never lacking in good conversation or bouts of laughter.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re terrible at faking emotions, so our faces usually betray any attempt to stifle them.</span>\n\n**We’re very picky about who we spend time with**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alone time is precious to us, so choosing to spend time with other people is a big deal.  If we choose the wrong person, we can be easily drained and overwhelmed.  Other introverts are a good choice because of their groundedness and sense of control, while extroverts tend to wane on us.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being around other introverts is easy because of the mutual understandings.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being charismatic, outgoing and lively in social settings is something that most people desire, not only for themselves, but for

When I pulled up to the pump I shut my car off and saw this middle aged man crying looking at the gas pump. I began to wonder what happened with this man and as I got out of my car and looked at him my heart felt like it stopped.”\n\n![](http://cdn4.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2016/04/5399202806_86c8343d06_b-600x398.jpg)\n\n“In Apple Valley, Minnesota it is 10 degrees and freezing cold with the wind. This man was wearing flip flops with socks covered in holes. I look at his car and see his wife in the front seat covering her face in her hands and the 2 teenage girls both cuddling under a blanket in the back seat.”\n\n<div class="caption">“I didn’t even think and I went up to the man and said ‘sir is something the matter?’ He looked at me and I could tell he was on the verge of giving up because he didn’t even try to conceal his tears when he said ‘I can’t even provide for my family.’”\n\nWithout even thinking I put my card in his machine and told him Jesus Christ the Son of God died to provide for you. Fill up. Something, something came alive in him. He was in shock and it was like he forgot how to pump gas. “\n\n</div><div>“In that same moment his wife got out of her car, she asked her husband what was going on and he told her I just payed for their gas she started to cry and came around the corner to shake my hand when I saw her pants dirty and torn. I asked her to come to my car.\n\nThe airport lost some of my luggage on my way to Minnesota from California and I had to clean out my closet to find stuff to wear and get rid of a lot of stuff all of that stuff that I had yet to give away was siting in the back seat of the car and in the trunk. I opened up my car and told the lady to take what she wanted.”\n\n![](http://cdn6.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2016/04/car.large_-600x387.jpg)\n\n“This lady RAN back to her car. I was so afraid I had just embraced her but a moment later her and her two girls were digging through those clothes layering my sweatshirts and shirts and sweat pants over the worn out clothes they had been wearing.\n\nSoon the father had finished pumping the gas and came over. This attracted a little crowd at the gas station. And some older man gave the family a gift card and another middle aged man gave away his jacket to the father. Never in my life did I think I would see this kind of thing happen at a gas station with a handful of complete strangers.”\n\n![](http://cdn5.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2016/04/11811504_921279941277081_1282386861773519412_n-600x600.jpg)\n\n</div><div> “But it gives me hope.

That God’s love is greater than anything and we get to be a part of that love changing lives.

When I pulled up to the pump I shut my car off and saw this middle aged man crying looking at the gas pump. I began to wonder what happened with this man and as I got out of my car and looked at him my heart felt like it stopped.”</p>\n\n<p><img src="http://cdn4.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2016/04/5399202806_86c8343d06_b-600x398.jpg" alt="" /></p>\n\n<p>“In Apple Valley, Minnesota it is 10 degrees and freezing cold with the wind. This man was wearing flip flops with socks covered in holes. I look at his car and see his wife in the front seat covering her face in her hands and the 2 teenage girls both cuddling under a blanket in the back seat.”</p>\n\n<div class="caption">“I didn’t even think and I went up to the man and said ‘sir is something the matter?’ He looked at me and I could tell he was on the verge of giving up because he didn’t even try to conceal his tears when he said ‘I can’t even provide for my family.’”\n\nWithout even thinking I put my card in his machine and told him Jesus Christ the Son of God died to provide for you. Fill up. Something, something came alive in him. He was in shock and it was like he forgot how to pump gas. “\n\n</div><div>“In that same moment his wife got out of her car, she asked her husband what was going on and he told her I just payed for their gas she started to cry and came around the corner to shake my hand when I saw her pants dirty and torn. I asked her to come to my car.\n\nThe airport lost some of my luggage on my way to Minnesota from California and I had to clean out my closet to find stuff to wear and get rid of a lot of stuff all of that stuff that I had yet to give away was siting in the back seat of the car and in the trunk. I opened up my car and told the lady to take what she wanted.”\n\n<img src="http://cdn6.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2016/04/car.large_-600x387.jpg" alt="" />\n\n“This lady RAN back to her car. I was so afraid I had just embraced her but a moment later her and her two girls were digging through those clothes layering my sweatshirts and shirts and sweat pants over the worn out clothes they had been wearing.\n\nSoon the father had finished pumping the gas and came over. This attracted a little crowd at the gas station. And some older man gave the family a gift card and another middle aged man gave away his jacket to the father. Never in my life did I think I would see this kind of thing happen at a gas station with a handful of complete strangers.”\n\n<img src="http://cdn5.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2016/04/11811504_921279941277081_1282386861773519412_n-600x600.jpg" alt="" />\n\n</div><div> “But it gives me hope.

Over the years, as in any type of social setting, unspoken ‘rules’ have been set in place by the people that operate within that setting. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know what I’m talking about. When you’re scrolling your newsfeed and a dramatic, paragraph-length post pops up from one of your friends who is visibly upset and angry about something? How many times have you rolled your eyes because you thought to yourself, “Facebook really is not the place you should be bashing your ex-girlfriend.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five rules of Facebook etiquette that we should all get on board with to make Facebook a better place for everyone:</span>\n\n<b>Vaguebooking</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was in my angsty teen years, I was all about ‘vaguebooking.’ Vaguebooking is basically a clickbait-styled post that is purposely vague so as to draw attention to it, or to passive-aggressively send a message to a person they’re angry with.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I did it, I usually posted song lyrics that I knew no one would recognize, but secretly hoped they would. Other times, it shows up as stuff like, “I can’t believe he would do that to me, what a jerk.” No one really has any idea what you’re talking about.</span>\n\n<b>Announcements</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Announcements on Facebook are not inherently bad. In fact, I would argue that social media was created to give us the ability to reach a wide audience with our messages. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The etiquette part of this depends entirely on the importance of the announcement. Throwing out details to a party this weekend is fine. But, when it’s something big and important, a phone call to the people who really matter in your life is much more tasteful. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last thing you want is your siblings or parents finding out about your engagement on Facebook.</span>\n\n<b>Using Facebook to promote other social media</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While some people like to use </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> form of social media available today, many Facebookers could care less about what’s happening on Twitter or Tumblr. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If we were really interested in what you’re doing on these other platforms, we’d be using that other platform. It’s best to keep Facebook undiluted.</span>\n\n<b>Discussing matters that are not yours to discuss</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When your friends and family are going through a tough time, you always want to help them out. But if you think that you’re helping them by spreading the word about it, you could be very wrong. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people don’t want their personal issues and problems broadcast to the world.

1477	91dcccc2-190c-4b61-9203-5cc776880640	Your Zodiac Sign Says A Lot About How You Express Anger	your-zodiac-sign-says-a-lot-about-how-you-express-anger	\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anger is one of those emotions that comes out in everyone differently. Some of us have short fuses that ignite some of the biggest bombs ever seen; others let their angry thoughts bounce around inside of them, reluctant to express them. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Zodiac sign has a lot to do with how you handle your anger. And knowing how to handle your anger is the first step in building healthier, more positive thought patterns.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is how each Zodiac sign expresses anger:</span>\n\n**Aries**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a fire sign, Aries are known for blowing up and fast. They’re not known for starting arguments or conflict, but they’re incredibly good at ending them. If they aren’t ready to do something, or get forced into something, you will likely see the fire within them. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, just as they’re quick to ignite, they’re quick to forgive and forget.</span>\n\n**Taurus**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes a lot to anger the Taurus, but, should you succeed, good luck trying to make it out alive. They don’t like to waste their energy on angry thoughts, but if you betray them, are disloyal or treat them as inferior, they’re ready to rumble. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Give them the time and space they need to calm down as they can stay angry for long periods of time.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s anyone’s guess as to how the Twins will express their anger. They like to cut deep wounds with a calm, centered demeanor, and they absolutely love to talk. So, if you piss them off, you will undoubtedly get an earful. Just don’t tell them what to do and they’ll likely forgive you.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Underneath the Cancer’s hard and protective shell lies a loyal, understanding and sweet being whose only wish is for people to return their affection. This is what usually upsets the Cancer; feeling unloved or unappreciated. You can always tell when a Cancer is angry because they’ll usually sulk around passive-aggressively. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t ignore their pleas, it will only hurt them more.</span>\n\n**Leo**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">An angry Leo has no trouble telling you exactly how they feel. Ranting, raving, kicking, screaming.. The leo is very capable of making a grand spectacle. And, they’re quick to say things that really hurt, so if they do, just know that it’s one of the only ways they know how to release their anger: venting. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re not likely to hold a grudge, however, and will probably move past most conflicts fairly fast.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Known for being both patient and loving, the Virgo has a great capacity for abuse before being set off in an angry way. Because they like to avoid confrontation, Virgos will often become incredibly passive aggressive. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re not going to hold a grudge, but they’re not going to forget about what you did, either.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a peacekeeper, the Libra’s scales fit perfectly here. Balance is valued in everything, especially relationships. This means that confrontation is often avoided, and emotions get bottled up. Even when they’re at the peak of their frustration, Libras do their best to wear a happy face as they hold back their rage. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the hurt is great enough, they are definitely capable of holding a grudge.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to other signs, the Scorpio doesn’t let out anger as it comes to them. You can always tell if a Scorpio is angry by looking into their eyes. Their eyes will say more than anything. They’re usually venting in their minds, planning their next move. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they suddenly get really quiet and you see angry eyes come out, give them some space. And don’t try to force them into anything before they’re ready.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Surefire ways to piss off a Sagittarius include dishonesty, disloyalty, being cruel and spewing hate speech. While they tend to be a patient sign, and they don’t angry very often, when they do get angry they’re not interested in playing nice, </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">at all</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll know they’re starting to get angry when the heavy sarcasm starts pouring out.</span>\n\n**Capricorn**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an Earth sign, Capricorns aren’t too pent up with anger. They like to keep things easy-going, but also have a threshold you can reach. You’re most likely to piss them off by accidentally messing up the ‘zen’ of their space. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Capricorns get angry for seemingly random reasons, and they don’t like to express it. They enjoy sulking before they’re ready to throw a tantrum.</span>\n\n**Aquarius**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Arguing is the last thing the Aquarius wants to do, so that’s what they tend to avoid, choosing to completely ignore people instead. If they can’t seem to get away from whatever it is that’s upsetting them, they’re likely to blow up just because of how frustrated they are. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on who they’re arguing with, they may or may not want to continue the relationship.</span>\n\n**Pisces**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pisces is somewhat volatile, meaning you never know what’s going to light their fuse. If they’re having a bad day already, it’s easier for them to explode. But, they don’t enjoy confrontation and would rather avoid it. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a smoke or a drink won’t help, they know that crying will. Of all the signs, Pisceans tend to cry the most when it comes to anger and frustration.</span>\n\nh/t [**SpiritScience**](http://thespiritscience.net/2016/07/13/how-each-sign-of-the-zodiac-expresses-their-anger/)\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anger is one of those emotions that comes out in everyone differently. Some of us have short fuses that ignite some of the biggest bombs ever seen; others let their angry thoughts bounce around inside of them, reluctant to express them. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Zodiac sign has a lot to do with how you handle your anger. And knowing how to handle your anger is the first step in building healthier, more positive thought patterns.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is how each Zodiac sign expresses anger:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Aries</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a fire sign, Aries are known for blowing up and fast. They’re not known for starting arguments or conflict, but they’re incredibly good at ending them. If they aren’t ready to do something, or get forced into something, you will likely see the fire within them. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, just as they’re quick to ignite, they’re quick to forgive and forget.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Taurus</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes a lot to anger the Taurus, but, should you succeed, good luck trying to make it out alive. They don’t like to waste their energy on angry thoughts, but if you betray them, are disloyal or treat them as inferior, they’re ready to rumble. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give them the time and space they need to calm down as they can stay angry for long periods of time.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gemini</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s anyone’s guess as to how the Twins will express their anger. They like to cut deep wounds with a calm, centered demeanor, and they absolutely love to talk. So, if you piss them off, you will undoubtedly get an earful. Just don’t tell them what to do and they’ll likely forgive you.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Cancer</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underneath the Cancer’s hard and protective shell lies a loyal, understanding and sweet being whose only wish is for people to return their affection. This is what usually upsets the Cancer; feeling unloved or unappreciated. You can always tell when a Cancer is angry because they’ll usually sulk around passive-aggressively. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t ignore their pleas, it will only hurt them more.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Leo</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An angry Leo has no trouble telling you exactly how they feel. Ranting, raving, kicking, screaming.. The leo is very capable of making a grand spectacle. And, they’re quick to say things that really hurt, so if they do, just know that it’s one of the only ways they know how to release their anger: venting. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re not likely to hold a grudge, however, and will probably move past most conflicts fairly fast.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Virgo</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known for being both patient and loving, the Virgo has a great capacity for abuse before being set off in an angry way.

We identify all the things we DON’T have, and we go to work to try to make them happen. </span>\n\n<span class="s1">So, we focus on the boyfriend we don’t have yet, the promotion we haven’t gotten, or the weight we haven’t lost yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We focus on what is lacking in order to try to create what is wanted into our realities.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Unfortunately, this strategy doesn’t work! You’ve gotta make peace with what is first.</span>\n\n\n## <span class="s1">When life isn’t good enough as it is</span>\n\n<span class="s1">If you focused on why your life isn’t good enough as it is, you only amplify the “my life isn’t good enough” vibe. Then, thanks to the Law of Attraction, your life will continue to feel “not good enough!” Your reality will always reflect back to you your dominant belief structure.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">For example, you can’t focus on how much your hate your current home and hope you’ll be able to find one you’ll love. Sure, you may move and you may find a new home.  However, rest assured, you will be just as dissatisfied with your new home as you were with the old one. </span>\n\n<span class="s1">This is because with the LOA we are always creating whatever is a match to our dominant thought patterns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we believe where we live sucks, then where we live must continue to suck. It doesn’t matter where we go or how many times we move.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">You’d be much more successful in making peace with your current home, and coming to love it as it is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once you make peace with your current home, you become a match to homes you love. </span><span class="s1">The universe will knock its socks off to match whatever you’re putting out there.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">So, if you want your life to be great, you have to start projecting the vibe that says “my life is great now!” This is done by making peace with what is, and loving it as it stands.</span>\n\n\n## <span class="s1">Why so many people project dissatisfaction over satisfaction</span>\n\n<span class="s1">I know making peace with what is can seem a bit counterintuitive. </span>\n\nMost people have been raised to believe they have to improve their lives, and that their lives aren’t good enough as they are. People are also often taught to evaluate the problems in their lives more closely than the blessings.\n\n<span class="s1">Unfortunately, this social programming keeps many of us stuck in a rut. This is why you know a guy who’s on his third failed marriage. This is why you have a friend who is always sick. This is why so many people go on a different diet every year.  \n</span>\n\n<span class="s1">When we focus on what’s lacking, we create more lack. On the surface things may change, but it’s just the same shit, different day.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Remind yourself of this principle of the LOA on a regular basis. When you find yourself criticizing where you are, remember you are perpetuating lack. Being happy where you stand will make you a match to people, events and situations that reinforce your happiness, not your lack.</span>\n\n\n## <span class="s1">How do you make peace with what is?</span>\n\n<span class="s1">One thing you can do right now to make peace with where you are is to play the “perspective game.” The perspective game enables you to make peace with where you are in the present moment.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">To play this game, step into someone else’s shoes and evaluate your life from an alternative perspective.  List out the things you have, and view them from the perspective of* not* having them. Imagine living a life where the things you have right now are still just dreams to you. The bigger the list, the better.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">Here is a short list of things I have in my life.  To play the perspective game, I write out the list, and then take a moment imagining my life without these blessings: </span>\n\n1. <span class="s1">I have two healthy and adorable children.</span>\n2. <span class="s1">I have a wonderful husband who loves me and treats me like a queen.</span>\n3. <span class="s1">I have a great relationship with my brother. He is a kindred spirit to me.</span>\n4. <span class="s1">I have close friends I get to spend lots of time with.</span>\n5. <span class="s1">I have a bunch of friendly and positive clients and I run my own business.</span>\n6. <span class="s1">I’m healthy and in good shape.</span>\n7. <span class="s1">I’ve had an exceptional education, and I have lots of skills and knowledge that benefit me because of it.</span>\n8. <span class="s1">I live near the beach.</span>\n9. <span class="s1">I drive my own car.</span>\n10. <span class="s1">I get to vacation several times every year.</span>\n11. <span class="s1">I own my own home.</span>\n12. <span class="s1">I have money in the bank and my expenses are always paid with ease.</span>\n13. <span class="s1">I really like all of my neighbors.</span>\n14. <span class="s1">I’ve got an awesome phone and computer and all kinds of cool technological gadgets.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">To me, each of the items on this list seems very normal to me, because they are each a part of my current reality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, these things are HUGE dreams for some people out there. </span>\n\n<span class="s1">In fact, just looking at this list makes me feel like my life is pretty great.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  I can’t even imagine living a life without my relationships, my health or my education. Yet,* *there are people out there who live without these blessings every day.</span></span>\n\nIt’s very hard for me to justify dissatisfaction with my life when I look at things from this perspective.  I’m just too grateful for what I have when I look at it this way.\n\n\n## <span class="s1">Why perspective matters</span>\n\n<span class="s1">When I look at this list through the perspective of those who don’t have what I already have, it reminds me just how blessed I truly am. When I look at my life through this lens, it’s easy for me to make peace with where I am. </span>\n\n***Related Article:**[20 Heartfelt Ways to Say Thank You](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/01/06/heartfelt-ways-to-say-thank-you/ "LOA Article")*\n\n<span class="s1">When I look through my life focused on what I *haven’t *created or achieved, it’s much, much easier to feel unfulfilled. I’m not at peace when I evaluate my life based on my unfulfilled dreams.  How at peace I am with my life has everything to do with which perspective I choose to take.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">In playing this perspective game, you come to see all of the wonderful things you have already created in your life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You are focused on what you HAVE rather than what you DON’T have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This projects a vibe that shouts out “I am fortunate in so many ways!”</span>\n\n<span class="s1">A message like this becomes reinforced in your reality, allowing more and more good things to come into your life. The universe must continue to bless you, if you believe you are blessed.</span>\n\n\n## <span class="s1">Work within the paradox!</span>\n\n<span class="s1">So, if you are wanting to use the Law of Attraction to improve your quality of life, make sure you are working within the paradox.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ve gotta make peace with what is before something better will come along. </span>\n\n<span class="s1">Remember, your life is great *right here and now, regardless of where you stand.  *There are always dreams you have achieved, and there are always reasons to be grateful.* *When you acknowledge this truth and declare your life to be great, your life will reflect greatness back to you in spades.</span>\n\n<span class="s1">How is your life already great?

This string is said to bind together any two people whose destinies are intertwined. This intangible thread that connects to people to one another is said to be unbreakable and not bound by time, place or circumstance.</span>\n\n**Red**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Red is the color most strongly linked to attraction and desire. This is the natural color of the string of fate that connects two people.</span>\n\n**Its Origins**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The red string of fate is a legend that has its roots in ancient East Asian culture. This version of the tale speaks a red string that binds together the ankles of people who will meet each other or come to help one another at a certain point in time.</span>\n\n**Soul mate**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Western culture has the notion of ‘soul mates,’ this legend is regarded in much the same way. The main difference between the red string of fate and a twin flame is that the East Asian proverb focuses mainly on two people being bound together, instead of each person discovering their other half.</span>\n\n**The Legend**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of the red string of fate comes from a young boy who was walking home one night. He discovered a man reading a book along the way, so he quickly asked him what it was he was reading. A book of marriages, said the old man, telling the young boy that his marriage was on the horizon. However, after showing the boy who he was destined to marry…</span>\n\n**The Trouble**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">He was not interested in the idea of marriage. He just didn’t want to do it. So he tossed a rock at the girl and ran off in the opposite direction. After years had passed, another marriage was arranged for the boy, to one of the most beautiful girls in the village. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon seeing her for the first time, he saw she had a scar from where he had thrown that rock that fateful day years ago. The two of them were destined to be together, he could not deny it.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The red string of fate serves as a constant reminder that, regardless of who you find on the other end of it, you’re going to have to work to make the relationship last. Let it inspire loyalty, devotion and compassion with you and your partner.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because, no matter where you are or how far away you are from one another, the thread will always be binding the two of you together.</span>\n\nh/t [**Rebel Circus **](http://www.rebelcircus.com/blog/invisible-thread-two-people-meant-together/9)\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know there’s an ancient legend that speaks of an invisible red string of fate.

relationship, she is dedicated to seeing it succeed.  That deep commitment means that she’s likely to trust her partner unconditionally, care for him endlessly and love him passionately.  She puts her partner before herself and is willing to give everything she has, even if it leads her in the wrong direction.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Women who do not respect themselves will often end up in a hollow and harmful relationship, being manipulated and emotionally taken advantage of.  Self-respect is key to a healthy relationship, as men seek out women who are strong and independent, who recognize their worth and make sure that others recognize it as well.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-respect also gives you perspective.  The type of perspective that allows you to see something for what it truly is.  It gives a woman the power to leave the man she loves because it becomes crystal clear that she loved him for all of the wrong reasons.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few reasons that women will leave the men they fall in love with:</span>\n\n**Failure to communicate**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Women like having someone that they can talk with about things, and while they recognize that their partner cannot be with them 24/7, not being there when she needs you is a surefire way to get her to start packing her things.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, ‘being there’ means </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">actually</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> being there.  She wants you to listen and to give her feedback, not for you to simply nod and agree with everything she says.</span>\n\n**A physical connection is more important than you might think**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While men typically get pegged as the sexual ones in a relationship, women are just as sexual, if not more so.  Ignoring her sexual needs and desires will likely give off the impression that you’re getting your satisfaction elsewhere, or that she is unwanted.  Both of these damage the relationship.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Caring about your partner’s needs in bed also says that you value the relationship and that you want it to last.  Lust will always fade, but a true kind of love means you’re naturally attracted to your partner for much longer.</span>\n\n**Insecurity**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone has them, but some are better at hiding them than others.  Outwardly projecting your insecurities is a great way to turn someone off from you entirely.  If a woman’s partner doesn’t trust her, and is constantly expressing distrust in her, she sees it as a lack of love and faith.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you truly love your partner, you trust them entirely and know that they will not do anything to harm you.  This means no snooping through phones or email accounts looking for dirt.</span>\n\n**Lack of personal space**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">People absolutely need time to themselves, it’s a natural part of growing in life.  Suffocating a woman by not allowing her to spend time alone or with her friends causes resentment and unrest.  Always be sure to give her time and space to grow organically in her own way, just as you should be doing as well.</span>\n\n**You try to change her**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you fall in love with a woman, you should be sure that you’re falling for who she is, not who you think she will become or who you can transform her into.  Every person deserves to be loved for who they are, and being with someone who is constantly trying to change every aspect about who you are will drive you insane.</span>\n\nh/t

They’re hard to decipher and can do a number on anyone who’s not prepared.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Their complex nature makes them one of the most misunderstood signs in the zodiac, so if you’ve fallen for one, a bit of helpful information will serve to your benefit.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are five things that create the Scorpio’s ‘tough love’ mentality:</span>\n\n**They’re manipulative at times**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scorpios usually know exactly what they want, and they have numerous different ways of getting it. While they’re not keen on lying to anyone, their ability to weave a persuasive argument around the truth is unrivaled.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes they live with an attitude of ‘the end justifies the means,’ which helps in some aspects of life, but detriments others (i.e. relationships).</span>\n\n**The sex is *****great***\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because sex is such an important part of every Scorpio’s relationship, keeping it fun and exciting is not only easy for the Scorpio, but necessary.

Their deep loyalty to the people they choose to spend their time with is an admirable and sometimes redeeming quality.</span>\n\n**They can hold grudges**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurting the Scorpio is a very dramatic endeavor. If you wrong them, a grudge will start brewing within them the likes of which you’ve never seen.

The love you were looking for in your teenage years is not the same love that you were looking for in your twenties, a trend that I would imagine continues to hold up as we all grow older.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">But an interesting thing happens as we mature into old age. Love starts to become more delicate, more complicated. Not only does it become harder to fall in love, but truly letting go of any painful past loves can be even harder.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You would think that it would get easier as we move through the motions of each relationship or romantic experience, but it’s actually our deep understanding of relationships that makes the whole process so much more difficult.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as with most things in life, our perceptions create the emotions that we feel. Love is not inherently magical; it is our feelings and perceptions that create this feeling of magic. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, as we get older, that magic starts to wane, simply because our understanding of relationships (and our roles within them) becomes so clear that there’s no room left for mystery or magic.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, is there anyway to combat this? Kind of. One of the only ways we fall in love as we grow older is feeling that we </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">need</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> love. If you’re of the mindset that you don’t deserve love or truly need it, then it will never come your way.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I found love when I decided that I was ready to build something special with another person. I wanted someone in my life that would be willing to take the next steps with me, who wanted to be by my side during all of life’s adventures.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">And I didn’t have any of that before, because I didn’t truly want it. I was fine being by myself, adventuring solo, figuring things out on my own. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it makes sense why intelligent, independent people struggle to find love; they’re content doing the solo thing. It will only come to you once you feel that it has a place in your world.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever thought about how love changes and grows to mean different things at different points in your life?

Love is not inherently magical; it is our feelings and perceptions that create this feeling of magic. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, as we get older, that magic starts to wane, simply because our understanding of relationships (and our roles within them) becomes so clear that there’s no room left for mystery or magic.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, is there anyway to combat this? Kind of. One of the only ways we fall in love as we grow older is feeling that we </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">need</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> love. If you’re of the mindset that you don’t deserve love or truly need it, then it will never come your way.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found love when I decided that I was ready to build something special with another person. I wanted someone in my life that would be willing to take the next steps with me, who wanted to be by my side during all of life’s adventures.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I didn’t have any of that before, because I didn’t truly want it. I was fine being by myself, adventuring solo, figuring things out on my own. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it makes sense why intelligent, independent people struggle to find love; they’re content doing the solo thing. It will only come to you once you feel that it has a place in your world.</span></p>	http://cdn.heartcenteredrebalancing.com/2016/07/feature_image_talnondemplate.jpg	f	f	published	en_US	public	\N	\N	1	2016-07-30 04:53:19+00	1	2016-07-30 04:53:19+00	1	2016-07-30 04:53:19+00	1

Maybe you’re addicted to playing video games, maybe you’re addicted to working out, or maybe you’ve dabbled with addiction to hard drugs; either way, each and every addiction is indicative of a bigger problem in a person’s life.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">And each zodiac sign is complete with its own set of problems that we have to deal with.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Addiction can be a very detrimental aspect of life if it is not recognized until it’s too late, so here is a bit of insight as to what each sign is most likely to gravitate toward:</span>\n\n**Aries **<span style="font-weight: 400;">(March 21 – April 19) | Cocaine</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of the youngest signs of the zodiac, Aries are often of the opinion that life doesn’t move quick enough. Their personalities are usually a big mess of confidence mixed together with neediness.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re likely to choose cocaine over other substances because it reinforces their already fantastical perspective that they’re always slightly ahead of everyone else.</span>\n\n**Taurus **<span style="font-weight: 400;">(April 20 – May 20) | Cannabis / Food / Both</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taurus have almost too much patience for their own good. This patience oftentimes transforms into laziness, which means that the Taurus isn’t going to go out of his or her way to develop an addiction to crack or meth, simply because it’s a lot harder to find.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Food is the most likely addiction; pick up the phone, punch in some numbers, and food is at your door within 20 minutes.</span>\n\n**Gemini **<span style="font-weight: 400;">(May 21 – June 20) | Social Media</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain studies have found that Facebook can be more addictive than alcohol, a notion that Gemini can easily understand. Gemini hide from their feelings by compulsively communicating, jumping from conversation to the next.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They tend to enjoy doing a variety of different things, but never really get too involved with any of them. </span>\n\n**Cancer **<span style="font-weight: 400;">(June 21 – July 22) | Heroin</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroin suits the Cancer almost perfectly, as they prefer to retreat into reclusivity when the world around them starts to crumble. Wherever they gain the most comfort and security is where the Cancer gravitates to, and heroin has oft been described as being taken to a world literally everything is </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">okay</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">, as if you were a baby again without a care in the world.</span>\n\n**Leo **<span style="font-weight: 400;">(July 23 – August 22) | Shopping</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Leos tend to have materialistic tendencies, and vanity is one of their hallmark characteristics, so it makes perfect sense that a Leo would struggle with finances and irresponsible spending. Leo women like to sport designer clothing and expensive jewelry, while Leo men prefer to spend their money on new gadgets and luxury vehicles.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This all plays on the bigger issue of the Leo’s innate desire to be in the limelight as much as possible.</span>\n\n**Virgo **<span style="font-weight: 400;">(August 23 – September 22) | Codependency</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Virgo people naturally gravitate toward being in positions of caretaking, often putting their unique ability to problem solve and care for others to good use on those they care about. The downside to this trait becomes obvious when they put </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">too much</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> focus on the well being of others, and not enough on their own.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Virgos sometimes unconsciously seek out people who are struggling in life, seemingly unable to care for themselves. This lets them put their own life problems on the backburner in order to fix someone else’s.</span>\n\n**Libra **<span style="font-weight: 400;">(September 23 – October 22) | Love</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, as a sign that represents fairness and balance, Libras often struggle to embody the values that their sign is known for. From the start, they expect life to operate on a level of fairness that simply doesn’t exist, which frustrates them to the point of tears.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To add to the fire, they have a constant need for a partner to make them feel balanced. The Libra should focus on finding balance in their own life by getting rid of ridiculous expectations, and by not treating relationships like they’re the end-all-be-all.</span>\n\n**Scorpio **<span style="font-weight: 400;">(October 23 – November 21) | Sex / Porn</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scorpios are notorious for their adventurous nature in the bedroom; they’re highly passionate beings who consider sex to be very important in a relationship. Tie this in with their secluded and voyeuristic nature, and porn becomes a preferred sexual outlet.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Complex and somewhat confusing, while Scorpios truly desire intimate connection and passion with others, it’s also something that scares them the most.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius **<span style="font-weight: 400;">(November 22 – December 21) | Gambling / Drinking</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sagittarius is a sign closely tied to Jupiter, the planet of luck and gifts. They have a very broad view on life, always seeking out new information with a yearning to understand. As a sign of luck, they’re often quite optimistic when it comes to taking risks in life. A quality that easily carries over to betting money and throwing dice, or even drinking and driving.</span>\n\n**Capricorn **<span style="font-weight: 400;">(December 22 – January 19) | Pills / Eating Disorders</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Capricorns have a natural desire to be “high status” in society. So they’re most likely to have an addiction that can be passed off as somewhat acceptable, like pharmaceuticals. To keep a clean reputation and rise through the ranks in their career, having an addiction that is “prescribed” is a great way to hide it.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To fight this, the Capricorn should shift gears a little bit. Change the focus from what society values to what our higher selves value.</span>\n\n**Aquarius **<span style="font-weight: 400;">(January 20 – February 18) | Video Games / Body Mutilation</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aquarius likes to handle its feelings in small and very specific ways. And on top of that, they tend to try to ‘solve’ all of their emotions, rather than simply experiencing them on a real level. Video games provide a fantasy-like outlet through which they can channel their emotions, while body harming provides the physical outlet of releasing emotion without actually having to experience any sadness.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To solve this, the Aquarius needs to focus more on offering themselves the same kind of care and compassion that they easily give to everyone else.</span>\n\n**Pisces **<span style="font-weight: 400;">(February 19 – March 20) | Alcohol</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of the most empathic and sensitive signs of the zodiac, Pisces’ decision-making processes involve a lot of emotion. Their high degree of empathy means they’re usually attracted to people that are going no where. But because they fear hurting others, they tend to be reluctant about putting up healthy boundaries that might keep others out. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which makes alcohol the perfect way to escape having to deal with any of it. Fortunately, they also tend to be more in tune with their higher selves, and will likely find a better way to handle their problems.</span>\n\nh/t [**Elite Daily**](http://elitedaily.com/life/addictions-for-all-zodiac-signs/1464889/)\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addiction takes hold in almost everyone’s life, regardless of who we are, because addiction is unique for everyone.

Many people who are actually introverts often get described as ‘shy’ by their friends and family, but that’s simply because they don’t know the difference. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shyness is a trait that stems from a person’s fears and insecurities. Introverted folks don’t have a fear of people, it’s simply that being social is an exhausting endeavor for them. They need time alone to rejuvenate their energy and aren’t keen on talking just to talk.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel shy, but unafraid, you might just be an introvert. Here are five easy ways to tell:</span>\n\n**Small talk isn’t your thing**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Introverts tend to be thinkers and intellectuals, so they’re not super enthused about conversations that lack real substance. If you want to talk about big ideas, like life, ideology, theories, goals, etc., the introvert will undoubtedly open up. They’re good at listening and are good at picking up on subtle social cues.</span>\n\n**You take your time to respond to texts or messages**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you like to take the time to develop a thoughtful reply to the texts and messages you receive, you might be introverted. They don’t like to fire off random thoughts and ideas without feeling fully invested in what’s being said, just as they’re likely to stay quiet in a social setting if they feel they have nothing important to add to the conversation.</span>\n\n**Crowds and groups of people overwhelm you**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being around numerous people in close proximity to one another can be overstimulating for the introvert. They would much rather spend time with a few close friends, but even then, they’ll need alone time at some point to recharge. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you find yourself feeling drained after being social for prolonged periods of time, you’re definitely introverted.</span>\n\n**Anti-social?

Many people who are actually introverts often get described as ‘shy’ by their friends and family, but that’s simply because they don’t know the difference. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shyness is a trait that stems from a person’s fears and insecurities. Introverted folks don’t have a fear of people, it’s simply that being social is an exhausting endeavor for them. They need time alone to rejuvenate their energy and aren’t keen on talking just to talk.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel shy, but unafraid, you might just be an introvert.

They function and look like your average person, but once they’ve made their way into your life, havoc, chaos and sorrow are often the only things they have to offer you. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They enjoy latching onto happy, unsuspecting people, which is why some of the most genuine and kind folks often have to deal with toxic people the most. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five surprising reasons that you’re attracting toxic people in your life:</span>\n\n**You’re really good at listening**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">People who are really good at listening to what others have to say are always highly valued, especially in a world that has become so distracted by the technology at our fingertips. Toxic people will use this great quality of yours as a platform to hear themselves speak. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They can talk for hours about themselves (and the negative way they see the world) without showing any interest in what </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> have to say. They just like when others accept their view of the world as truth.</span>\n\n**You give people the time of day**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Generosity is undoubtedly a great quality to have, but when it comes to toxic people, it can be highly detrimental. Generosity is something that toxic individuals seek out on a regular basis, simply because they know that they can take advantage of a person who will do anything for them. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re likely to grab hold and not let go if you’re always at their beck and call. </span>\n\n**You have an easygoing nature**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Easygoing people are fun to be around. They pretty much always keep their cool and are very good at diffusing uncomfortable situations with clever jests or kind words. They’re usually very patient and kind, a trait that stems from the inner peace that they’ve found. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately for these people, their inner peace is exactly what attracts toxic people, simply because they wish to disrupt it.</span>\n\n**You’re good at solving conflict, building bridges**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When arguments and feuds go unresolved, the bridge builder will go to great lengths to see the relationship mended. Many people love you for your ability to bring people together, and are often quite grateful. Toxic people love these types because they love to destroy bridges. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating drama and conflict between others is something they truly enjoy.</span>\n\n**You see humanity in a very positive light**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I like to believe that most people see their fellow man as inherently good-natured and kind, just as I do. And I’d say that most people’s daily interactions with each other prove this to be true. However, every now and then we experience the dark side of folks. If you’re the type of person who has trouble finding the darkness in others, you could be inviting toxic people into your life without even realizing it. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you put up with a crappy friend out of hope that they will change? Do you completely ignore their poor behavior and distasteful acts, choosing to hang out with them anyway? Maybe it’s time to re-evaluate your friendship.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.marcandangel.com/2015/08/16/7-surprising-reasons-youre-attracting-toxic-people/</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning how to spot the toxic people in your life can be hard if you’re not sure what to look for.

Not everyone is blessed with loving friends, let alone one good, amazing friend who always has your back no matter what. I recently stumbled across a BFF of my own and I have to say, it’s a pretty great feeling. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you have a BFF, but he or she lives across the world from you, making your relationship more long distance than anything. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing! </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the closest and most passionate relationships happen at a distance, so if you have a long distance BFF, here are four reasons that they’re so great:</span>\n\n**You don’t have any other choice but to communicate with one another**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because your long distance BFF might not run into you at the store, make a surprise visit to your place of work for some lunch, or get to meet up with you for happy hour on Friday, you have to actually work to communicate with them.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This means you set aside time specifically for them to discuss the important happenings of life. Whether it’s a big promotion at work or a crazy story from the weekend, your communication is valued and genuine.</span>\n\n**They help you see from other perspectives**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s incredibly easy to get so caught up in your own life that you forget there’s an entire world that exists outside of your own. Your long distance BFF, who is outside of it all, knows exactly how to bring you back to a grounded state: they’ll tell you how it is, no sugarcoating. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who only has your best interests in mind, the long distance BFF will always give you real advice when you need it. You don’t need to worry about them having ulterior motives or wanting to stir up drama, because they’re a thousand miles away.</span>\n\n**The time you do get to spend together is priceless**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Reunited and it feels so good’ has never been more accurate than when two long distance BFFs come together after a long time apart. This is definitely one case where absence makes the heart grow fonder. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the two of you talk on the phone regularly, you never run out of things to say and share when you finally meet up in person.</span>\n\n**Your relationship takes work from both of you, work you can be proud of**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every person who’s ever had a BFF knows that it’s not always sunshine and rainbows. Having good friends isn’t always easy, but it’s almost always worth it. Having that BFF be long distance only adds to the work. You have to want it in order for it work. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re content sending a text every now and then when you remember something funny or simply don’t have time to communicate, you’re not showing the other person that you want them in your life.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Good friends are hard to come by, so if you and your friend put in the time and effort to make it work, that’s something you can both be proud of. So, take the time to let your long distance BFF know just how important they are to you!</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a BFF, you’re pretty lucky.

It probably </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">feels</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> like it should be the easiest thing in the world, because c’mon, you’re boiling an egg, but it’s often quite difficult to perfect this practice. Do it wrong, and you’re left with an egg no one wants to eat.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is it so difficult? Well, eggs actually consist of two parts: the yolk and the white. And each of them have different compositional makeups, which means they also have unique cooking temperatures.</span>\n\n**[According to J. Kenji](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-food-lab-j-kenji-lopez-alt/1121137395) [López-Alt](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-food-lab-j-kenji-lopez-alt/1121137395),**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Egg whites cook best at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">180°F (82°C). This temperature allows for a sturdy, yet tender egg white. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ideal temperature for the yolk? About 10 degrees hotter than the egg white. But, if you cook the yolk above </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">170°F (77°C), it starts to dry out and crumble.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Peeling is another factor when boiling eggs. If you put your eggs in cold water to begin with, the egg will bind to the shell, which makes peeling them almost impossible. And if you drop your eggs into boiling water, there’s a good chance you’ll cook the whites before the yolks. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what should you be doing instead? </span>\n\n[**J.

Once they’ve cooked a bit, you begin to add ice cubes in order to lower the water’s temperature. Then you finish with a slow, gradual cook of the eggs.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the method looks like this: bring your water to a boil, gently place your eggs in the water and let them sit for 30 seconds. Then, add ice to the water to bring the temperature down. Once you’ve added the ice, you’re pretty much done. Let the water come back up to boiling and cook the eggs for at least 11 minutes at around 190</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°F.</span>\n\n**Et voilà! **<span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfectly boiled eggs.</span>\n\n \n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever tried to boil an egg, you know that it’s not the easiest thing in the world.

They know what you’re thinking, your attitudes toward certain things, and enjoy being there for you during moments of weakness.</span>\n\n**They love to make you smile and laugh**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect partner loves to see their significant other smile and be as happy as possible. If your partner’s sense of humor is something you adore, you’ll never tire of them.</span>\n\n**They’re there for you, even when you’re grumpy**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect partner recognizes when their significant other is upset, irritated or frustrated, and doesn’t get down about it. They know that you have your angry moments just like everyone else. They’re not about to let those moments keep them from loving you, they know to just give you space every now and then.</span>\n\n**They’re not judgmental of your choices when it comes to their appearance**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A great spouse always supports their partner, especially when it comes to them wanting to look better or feel more attractive. However you want to present yourself to the world, they love you for it.</span>\n\n**They’ll always be upfront with you**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A great partner will never beat around the bush or lie to you. They will always give you their honest opinion because they always have your best interests in mind. </span>\n\n**They’re good at righting any wrongs, even if it’s not immediate**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone makes mistakes, and a good partner knows this. If they’ve done something to upset you or frustrate you, they know that they’ll make it up to you in one way or another. Just give them some time; they always figure it out.</span>\n\n**They understand that special moments together will always trump any sort of material possession**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A good partner would rather do something with his or her significant other that will create lasting memories for both of you. Buying someone luxurious and expensive things is nice, but those things will never be able to match the feelings you have when you and your partner experience something together.</span>\n\n**They give your family the same respect they give their own**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When your better half respects and treats your family as if they were their own, you know you’ve found a keeper. Family time is always better when everyone loves and respects each other.</span>\n\n**They truly listen, and care about what’s going on in your life**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Something that truly makes a partner great is how good they are at listening to you. If they’re genuinely concerned with how your day is going and want to fix anything wrong in your life, they’re perfect for you.</span>\n\n**They enjoy showing how much they appreciate you in different ways**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes saying “I love you” just doesn’t adequately describe how much you care for a person.

Fantasy and nonsensical things happen regularly without question, but there is something to be taken away from certain things that you see.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re dreaming of certain objects or symbols, they could hold hidden meanings. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for these seven symbols when you find yourself in dreamland:</span>\n\n**Boxes**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you start seeing boxes in dreamworld, it’s a good sign that you feel something is being hidden from you. Empty boxes symbolize emotions of disappointment, and a large number of boxes can mean that you’re struggling with your emotions and want to stash them somewhere else.</span>\n\n**Phones**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s a phone ringing in your dream, it can mean that certain personality traits of yours are starting to come into alignment with your being. If a phone is ringing and you choose not to answer it, it can mean that you want to ignore any messages or insights that you are trying to send yourself.</span>\n\n**Flying**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you find yourself flying through the air in your dream, it’s a good sign that the dream has become lucid. Lucid dreams often happen when your subconscious is trying to reach you. Flying is symbolic of challenges or obstacles you’re working to overcome in real life.</span>\n\n**The Moon**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any dreams that have the moon in them can be indicative of a hidden creativity that is eager to be let out. </span>\n\n**Roads**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Different types of roads can mean different things. Easy-going, paved, clean roads indicate that you feel the journey ahead of you will be relatively easy. But, if the road is dark, hard to see and you struggle navigating it, it can mean that you’re afraid of what’s to come.</span>\n\n**Flowers**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Flowers and plants can mean different things when you spot them in your dreams. If flowers are budding, it’s a sign that opportunity is just around the corner. If the flowers are dying or wilting, it can be a sign that this chapter of life is coming to an end. If you see little sproutlings, it can mean that any seeds you’ve planted are about to grow.</span>\n\n**Water**\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Water takes many forms, but they often reflect how ambitious you are in life. Dreams about the ocean can mean that you’re ready to take advantage of grand opportunities by taking a few risks. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re dreaming of shallow bodies of water, it can mean that you’re focusing too much on something that is out of your reach at the moment.</span>\n\n\n	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dream world is a place where unusual and bizarre happenings don’t even make us think twice.

Once we’re out of school and thrusted into the real world, not every day is a social party where you’re surrounded by people you consider your friends. In fact, many people go to great lengths to try and make friends, but the truth is that if the other person isn’t interested, it probably won’t happen.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why it can be so hard to befriend introverts. As quiet, reserved folks, these people often get labeled as strange and unfriendly because, in Western culture, being quiet and reserved carries with it a somewhat negative stigma.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t let their behavior or attitude deter you when you know they’d make a good friend if you could get them to open up a little. Introverts make some of the best friends, so here are five things you can do, and five things you should avoid doing, to help your chances:</span>\n\n<b>Things you should try not to do:</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do your best to never put them “on the spot” when you’re around a large group of people. The attention makes them uncomfortable and embarrassed.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t try to make small talk. Introverts often despise small talk, preferring instead to discuss matters of actual substance. Plus, small talk puts pressure on them to come up with conversation.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t act like their shy personality is a certain ‘condition’ or illness. They’re not interested in making friends with people who see them as charity cases.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re talking with them, let the conversation flow naturally. If you awkwardly struggle to maintain a conversation, it will make their insides crawl. They hate awkward situations.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try not to force them to do anything that is outside of their realm of comfort. They’re simply not going to try something new just because you want them to. They will never trust you again and will likely never want to see you again.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<b>Things you want to do:</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to be by yourself when you approach an introvert, as groups of people make introverts feel a tad bit socially overwhelmed.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a soothing, somewhat quiet voice when you speak to them. This puts them at ease and is easier to process than loud, abrasive tones.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a mutual interest or problem and then talk about it together. Introverts like building connections over personal and meaningful conversation.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only hang out with them for short periods of time at first. They enjoy having time to work through things, which includes you and everything you’ve said to them. So give them space and time to make up their mind about you.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make eye contact only for brief moments. When you maintain eye contact for too long, the brain’s ‘fight-or-flight’ mechanism becomes triggered, making you seem more intimidating than you are.	\N	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you continue to get older, making friends continues to get harder.

They cause a myriad of heart problems and dramatically increase your risk for lung cancer. If you’re someone who smokes and has been wanting to quit (or someone who never wants to quit), you can start improving lung health right now with a handful of different methods.\n\nWhile you shouldn’t expect perfectly healthy lungs over night, these five natural substances will help best to detox your lungs of nicotine and tar:\n\nCorn\n\nYou’re probably thinking, “Corn?” Yes, corn. It’s chock-full of cryptoxanthin, an antioxidantal substance that has been seen to protect the lungs from cancer. It is best to find fresh, organic corn.\n\nAnother antioxidant you can incorporate easily into a diet is the Brazil nut. Brazil nuts have naturally high levels of selenium.\n\nOnions\n\nOnions are a powerful lung cleanser, believe it or not. They’ve been seen to help prevent lung infections, among many other diseases. If you already have cancer, onions work to keep new mutated cells from forming.\n\nGinger\n\nGinger is a widely-used naturally medicinal food that helps protect against malignant illnesses. Ginger is a great substance to use for the lungs because it promotes healthy breathing. Ginger root tea is a great way to reap the benefits of this substance.\n\nOranges are also an easy food you can consume to help fight off any hints of lung cancer.\n\nNettle\n\nThe Nettle plant contains high levels of iron, but is often used to disinfect and protect the lungs.\n\nPine needles tea\n\nThis tea is used by many to clean the mouth and throat, but it’s also highly beneficial in the prevention of lung cancer.	\N	<p>It’s kind of strange how many people continue to smoke cigarettes in light of the overwhelming evidence that they basically kill you.

We’re always finding new ways to ease our conscience and put the mind at peace. String-based crafts have been a favorite pastime for humans for ages, but it makes sense because we derive so much happiness from being able to make things using our hands.\n\nWell, as it turns out, knitting, crocheting, lacemaking and many other string-based creative practices can actually improve your health in a variety of different ways.\n\nHere are five health benefits you pick up by practicing your hand at knitting and crocheting!\n\n**Reduced blood pressure and lower heart rate**\n\nFor those who already knit and crochet regularly, you’re fully aware of just how relaxing this craft can be and it’s probably part of the reason you do it. Relaxation is great for the human body. It helps reduce the production of cortisol, the body’s stress hormone, which in turn helps keep the heart and circulatory system healthy. Not to mention, stress hurts the body in a variety of other ways as well.\n\n**It keeps your hand-eye coordination sharp**\n\nHave you ever watched someone knit or crochet something? It looks as though their hands are moving a million miles an hour, repeating movements and techniques rapidly in quick succession.\n\nThese quick, repeated movements help improve the health of your hands. It helps keep your joints flexible and your muscles steady. While it might seem like a bad idea for people with arthritis, it’s actually quite helpful for maintaining mobility of the hands. Of course, it’s always good to take breaks too.\n\n**It sharpens math skills**\n\nOne of the coolest parts of knitting and crocheting is how much math is involved. I know, some of you are thinking the opposite, but don’t fret; it’s easy math and you can do it! Counting, multiplying, measuring and building patterns are all parts of knitting and crocheting that help improve your proclivity for math.\n\nYou might be doing it subconsciously, but your brain is still benefitting from the firing of these neurons.\n\n**It helps control anxiety**\n\nFor many folks, knitting is a largely meditative practice. It physically relaxes our bodies as our minds drift away from the hustle and bustle of life and the world around us. This combination of physical and mental relaxation helps the mind shed its worries and anxieties.\n\n**It keeps your memory healthy**\n\nAs mentioned before, knitting has somewhat of a hidden layer of brain stimulation. The whole process is defined by doing certain steps in the correct order, over and over again.\n\nKnowing when to knit versus when to purl, knowing how many rows or loops to create, and knowing which colors to use when, are just a few things constantly churning in the heads of knitters. This means an almost constant use of your memory, which makes it stronger and stronger each time.\n\n	\N	<p>As humans, many of the things we do in life are therapeutic in nature.

Counting, multiplying, measuring and building patterns are all parts of knitting and crocheting that help improve your proclivity for math.</p>\n\n<p>You might be doing it subconsciously, but your brain is still benefitting from the firing of these neurons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It helps control anxiety</strong></p>\n\n<p>For many folks, knitting is a largely meditative practice. It physically relaxes our bodies as our minds drift away from the hustle and bustle of life and the world around us. This combination of physical and mental relaxation helps the mind shed its worries and anxieties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It keeps your memory healthy</strong></p>\n\n<p>As mentioned before, knitting has somewhat of a hidden layer of brain stimulation. The whole process is defined by doing certain steps in the correct order, over and over again.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing when to knit versus when to purl, knowing how many rows or loops to create, and knowing which colors to use when, are just a few things constantly churning in the heads of knitters. This means an almost constant use of your memory, which makes it stronger and stronger each time.</p>	http://cdn.heartcenteredrebalancing.com/2016/102016/10/feature_image_teknittingmplate.jpg	f	f	published	en_US	public	\N	\N	1	2016-10-14 21:54:17+00	1	2016-10-14 21:57:20+00	1	2016-10-14 21:57:20+00	1

Each one of us is passive to some extent, but it differs from person to person as we each perceive the world and our place in it differently than the next.\n\nWhile passivity can be helpful in certain situations, making it a habit is not necessarily a good thing. If we become too passive, it can be more detrimental to our lives than we realize.\n\nHere are five things passive people do regularly that might shed some light on your own habits and behavioral patterns:\n\n**They leave the fortune of their lives in the hands of “fate”**\n\nPassive people tend to take a non-active role in their life. One form of this is using ‘fate’ as a sign of things “not meant to be.” For example, when a relationship doesn’t work out, passive people tend to believe that if things were “meant to be,” then the relationship would be effortless.\n\nWell, relationships do take effort, and they’re more likely to succeed if both people actively work on bettering it.\n\n**They mistakenly equate failure with destiny**\n\nSimilar to the previous point, passive people will often view their failures or shortcomings as a sign that they’re just not suited for whatever it is they failed at.\n\nFailure is one of the most natural parts of human life. It is something we all struggle with on our journey. Learning to grow from failure is one of the best lessons a person can learn. Be patient with yourself, and don’t give up.\n\n**They believe that ‘luck’ is a large part of success**\n\nPassive people have never heard the phrase, “it seems the harder I work, the luckier I get.”\n\nLuck is not something any one person can control, but there are things we can control that might help us get lucky in the future, such as preparation, planning, timing and a solid work ethic. If we focus entirely on the things we have control over, we can increase our chances of getting lucky.\n\n**They seek the approval of others when they speak**\n\nWhen you’re in a group full of people who are all speaking openly about something, and then you chime in by asking if you can participate, you’ve already implied to the others that you are somehow “less than” they are.\n\nNever ask for permission to speak your mind, especially when you feel you can add to the conversation.\n\n**They place the needs of others before their own**\n\nSome passive people struggle with placing their own needs on the same level as the needs of others. This often manifests as doing things they don’t need to be doing for other people, like going out of their way to give them a ride home, or letting others decide what to eat for dinner.\n\nIf you want people to respect your desires and wishes, you must communicate in such a way that tells them you won’t settle for less. If you want something specific for dinner, say so. If you don’t want to give that person a ride home, then don’t.	\N	<p>Passivity is one of those things where there’s a right time and a right place for it.
